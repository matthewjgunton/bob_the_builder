Apartment Lease Contract ©2023, Texas Apartment Association, Inc.                                                                                                                 Page 2 of 6LEASE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. Definitions. The following terms are commonly used in this Lease: 
 1.1.  “Residents”  are those listed in “Residents” above who sign  
 this Lease and are authorized to live in the apartment. 
 1.2.  “Occupants”  are those listed in this Lease who are also autho-  
 rized to live in the apartment, but who do not sign this Lease. 
 1.3.  “Owner”  may be identified by an assumed name and is the  
 owner only and not property managers or anyone else. 
 1.4.  “Including”  in this Lease means “including but not limited to.” 
 1.5.  “Community Policies”  are the written apartment rules and  
 policies, including property signage and instructions for  
 care of our property and amenities, with which you, your  
 occupants, and your guests must comply. 
 1.6.  “Rent”  is monthly base rent plus additional monthly  
 recurring fixed charges.
 1.7.  “Lease”  includes this document, any addenda and  
 attachments, Community Policies and Special Provisions.
2.  Apartment. You are leasing the apartment listed above for use as a 
private residence only.
 2.1.  Access. In accordance with this Lease, you’ll receive access  
 information or devices for your apartment and mailbox, and  
 other access devices including: __________  ______________
 _______________________________________________  
 ______________________________________________. 
 2.2.  Measurements.  Any dimensions and sizes provided to you  
 relating to the apartment are only approximations or  
 estimates; actual dimensions and sizes may vary.
 2.3.  Representations. You agree that designations or accredi-  
 tations associated with the property are subject to change.
3.  Rent. You must pay your Rent on or before the 1st day of each 
month (due date) without demand. There are no exceptions  
regarding the payment of Rent, and you agree not paying Rent on 
or before the 1st of each month is a material breach of this Lease. 
 3.1.  Payments. You will pay your Rent by any method, manner  
 and place we specify in accordance with this Lease.  
 Cash is not acceptable without our prior written  
 permission. You cannot withhold or offset Rent unless  
 authorized by law.  We may, at our option, require at any  
 time that you pay Rent and other sums due in one single  
 payment by any method we specify.
 3.2.  Application of Payments.  Payment of each sum due is an  
 independent covenant, which means payments are due  
 regardless of our performance.  When we receive money,  
 other than water and wastewater payments subject to  
 government regulation, we may apply it at our option and  
 without notice first to any of your unpaid obligations, then  
 to accrued rent. We may do so regardless of notations on  
 checks or money orders and regardless of when the  
 obligations arose. All sums other than Rent and late fees are  
 due upon our demand. After the due date, we do not have  
 to accept any payments.
 3.3.  Late Fees.  If we don’t receive your monthly base rent in full  
 when it’s due, you must pay late fees as outlined in Lease Details.
 3.4.  Returned Payment Fee.  You’ll pay the fee listed in Lease  
 Details for each returned check or rejected electronic  
 payment, plus initial and daily late fees if applicable, until  
 we receive full payment in an acceptable method. 
 3.5.  Utilities and Services.  You’ll pay for all utilities and services,  
 related deposits, and any charges or fees when they are due  
 and as outlined in this Lease. Television channels that are  
 provided may be changed during the Lease term if the  
 change applies to all residents.
  If your electricity is interrupted, you must use only battery-  
 operated lighting (no flames). You must not allow any  
 utilities (other than cable or Internet) to be cut off or  
 switched for any reason—including disconnection for not  
 paying your bills—until the Lease term or renewal period  
 ends. If a utility is individually metered, it must be connected  
 in your name and you must notify the provider of your move-  
 out date. If you delay getting service turned on in your name  
 by this Lease’s start date or cause it to be transferred back into  
 our name before you surrender or abandon the apartment,  
 you’ll be liable for the charge listed above (not to exceed $50  
 per billing period), plus the actual or estimated cost of the  
 utilities used while the utility should have been billed to you.  
 If your apartment is individually metered and you change  
 your retail electric provider, you must give us written notice.  
 You must pay all applicable provider fees, including any fees  
 to change service back into our name after you move out.
 3.6.  Lease Changes.  Lease changes are only allowed during the  
 Lease term or renewal period if governed by Par. 10, specified  
 in Special Provisions in Par. 32, or by a written addendum or  
 amendment signed by you and us. At or after the end of the  
 initial Lease term, Rent increases will become effective with at  
 least 5 days plus the number of days’ advance notice contained  
 in Box F on page 1 in writing from us to you. Your new Lease,  
 which may include increased Rent or Lease changes, will begin  
 on the date stated in any advance notice we provide (without  
 needing your signature) unless you give us written move-out  
 notice under Par. 25, which applies only to the end of the current  
 Lease term or renewal period.4.  Automatic Lease Renewal and Notice of Termination. This Lease 
will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives 
written notice of termination or intent to move out as required by Par. 
25 and specified on page 1. If the number of days isn’t filled in, no -
tice of at least 30 days is required.   
5.  Security Deposit. The total security deposit for all residents is due 
on or before the date this Lease is signed. Any animal deposit will be 
designated in an animal addendum. Security deposits may not be ap -
plied to Rent without our prior written consent. 
 5.1.  Refunds and Deductions.  You must give us your advance  
 notice of move out as provided by Par. 25 and forwarding  
 address in writing to receive a written description and  
 itemized list of charges or refund.  In accordance with this  
 Lease and as allowed by law, we may deduct from your  
 security deposit any amounts due under this Lease. If you  
 move out early or in response to a notice to vacate, you’ll be  
 liable for rekeying charges.  Upon receipt of your move-out  
 date and forwarding address in writing, the security deposit  
 will be returned (less lawful deductions) with an itemized  
 accounting of any deductions, no later than 30 days after  
 surrender or abandonment, unless laws provide otherwise.  
 Any refund may be by one payment jointly payable to all  
 residents and distributed to any one resident we choose,   
 or distributed equally among all residents. 
6.  Insurance. Our insurance doesn’t cover the loss of or damage to 
your personal property.  You will be required to have liability insur -
ance as specified in this Lease unless otherwise prohibited by law. If 
you have insurance covering the apartment or your personal belong -
ings at the time you or we suffer or allege a loss, you agree to require 
your insurance carrier to waive any insurance subrogation rights. 
Even if not required, we urge you to obtain your own insurance for 
losses due to theft, fire, flood, water, pipe leaks and similar occurrenc -
es.  Most renter’s insurance policies don’t cover losses due to a flood.
7.  Reletting and Early Lease Termination.  This Lease may not be ter -
minated early except as provided in this Lease.
 7.1. Reletting Charge. You’ll be liable for a reletting charge as  
 listed in Lease Details, (not to exceed 85% of the highest  
 monthly Rent during the Lease term) if you: (A) fail to move in,  
 or fail to give written move-out notice as required in Par. 25;  
 (B) move out without paying Rent in full for the entire Lease  
 term or renewal period; (C) move out at our demand because  
 of your default; or (D) are judicially evicted. The reletting  
 charge is not a termination, cancellation or buyout fee and  
 does not release you from your obligations under this Lease,  
 including liability for future or past-due Rent, charges for  
 damages or other sums due.
  The reletting charge is a liquidated amount covering only  
 part of our damages—for our time, effort, and expense in  
 finding and processing a replacement resident. These  
 damages are uncertain and hard to ascertain—particularly  
 those relating to inconvenience, paperwork, advertising,  
 showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking pros-  
 pects, overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees.  
 You agree that the reletting charge is a reasonable estimate  
 of our damages and that the charge is due whether or not our  
 reletting attempts succeed. 
 7.2.  Early Lease Termination Option Procedure. In addition to  
 your termination rights referred to in 7.3 or 8.1 below,  if this  
 provision applies under Lease Details, you may opt to  
 terminate this Lease prior to the end of the Lease term if all of  
 the following occur:  (a) as outlined in Lease Details, you give  
 us written notice of early termination, pay the Early Termina-  
 tion Option fee in full and specify the date by which you’ll  
 move out; (b) you are not in default at any time and do not  
 hold over; and (c) you repay all rent concessions, credits or  
 discounts you received during the Lease term. If you are in  
 default, the Lease remedies apply.
 7.3.  Special Termination Rights. You may have the right under  
 Texas law to terminate this Lease early in certain situations  
 involving military deployment or transfer, family violence,  
 certain sexual offenses, stalking or death of a sole resident.  
8. Delay of Occupancy. We are not responsible for any delay of your 
occupancy caused by construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous 
resident’s holding over. This Lease will remain in force subject to  
(1) abatement of Rent on a daily basis during delay, and  (2) your right 
to terminate this Lease in writing as set forth below. Rent abatement 
and Lease termination do not apply if the delay is for cleaning or re -
pairs that don’t prevent you from moving into the apartment. 
 8.1.  Termination.  If we give written notice to you of a delay in  
 occupancy when or after this Lease begins, you may termi-  
 nate this Lease within 3 days after you receive written notice.
  If we give you written notice before the date this Lease begins  
 and the notice states that a construction or other delay is  
 expected and that the apartment will be ready for you to  
 occupy on a specific date, you may terminate this Lease within  
 7 days after receiving written notice.
  After proper termination, you are entitled only to refund of  
 any deposit(s) and any Rent you paid.

ments occurring during the Lease term or renewal period, includ -

RESIDENT LIFE
10.  Community Policies.  Community Policies become part of this 
Lease and must be followed. We may make changes, including addi -
tions, to our written Community Policies, and those changes can be -
come effective immediately if the Community Policies are distributed 
and applicable to all units in the apartment community and do not 
change the dollar amounts owed under this Lease. 
 10.1.  Photo/Video Release. You give us permission to use any  
 photograph, likeness, image or video taken of you while  
 you are using property common areas or participating in  
 any event sponsored by us. 
 10.2.  Disclosure of Information.  At our sole option, we may,  
 but are not obligated to, share and use information related

 purposes. At our request, you authorize any utility provider to  
 give us information about pending or actual connections or  
 disconnections of utility service to your apartment.
 10.3.  Guests.  We may exclude from the apartment community  
 any guests or others who, in our sole judgment, have been

 or owner representatives. We may also exclude from any  
 outside area or common area anyone who refuses to show  
 photo identification or refuses to identify himself or  
 herself as a resident, an authorized occupant, or a guest of  
 a specific resident in the community.
  Anyone not listed in this Lease cannot stay in the  
 apartment for more than _______ days in one week  
 without our prior written consent, and no more than twice  
 that many days in any one month. If the previous space  
 isn’t filled in, 2 days total per week will be the limit.

 notify us within 15 days if you or any of your occupants:  
 (A) are convicted of any felony, (B) are convicted of any  
 misdemeanor involving a controlled substance, violence to  
 another person, or destruction of property, or (C) register as a  
 sex offender. Informing us of a criminal conviction or  
 sex-offender registration doesn’t waive any rights we may  
 have against you.
 10.5.  Odors, Noise and Construction. You agree that odors  
 and smells (including those related to cooking),    
 everyday noises or sounds related to repair, renovation,  
 improvement, or construction in or around the property  
 are all a normal part of a multifamily living environment and  
 that it is impractical for us to prevent them from penetrating  
 your apartment. 
11.  Conduct. You agree to communicate and conduct yourself in a law -
ful, courteous and reasonable manner at all times when interacting 
with us, our representatives and other residents or occupants. Any 
acts of unlawful, discourteous or unreasonable communication or 
conduct by you, your occupants or guests is a breach of this Lease.
 You must use customary diligence in maintaining the apartment, 
keeping it in a sanitary condition and not damaging or littering the 
common areas. Trash must be disposed of at least weekly. You will 
use your apartment and all other areas, including any balconies, with 
reasonable care. We may regulate the use of passageways, patios, 
balconies, porches, and activities in common areas. 
 11.1.  Prohibited Conduct.  You, your occupants, and your guests  
 will not engage in certain prohibited conduct, including the  
 following activities: 
  (a) criminal conduct; manufacturing, delivering, or  
  possessing a controlled substance or drug parapher-  
  nalia; engaging in or threatening violence; possessing  
  a weapon prohibited by state law; discharging a firearm  
  in the apartment community; or, except when  
  allowed by law, displaying or possessing a gun, knife,  
  or other weapon in the common area, or in a way that  
  may alarm others; 
  (b) behaving in a loud, obnoxious or dangerous manner;   (c)  disturbing or threatening the rights, comfort, health, safety,  
  or convenience of others, including us, our agents, or our  
  representatives; 
  (d)  disrupting our business operations; 
  (e)  storing anything in closets containing water heaters or  
  gas appliances;
  (f)  tampering with utilities or telecommunication  
  equipment; 
  (g) bringing hazardous materials into the apartment  
  community; 
  (h) using windows for entry or exit; 
  (i)  heating the apartment with gas-operated appliances;
  (j)  making bad-faith or false allegations against us or our  
  agents to others;
  (k) smoking of any kind, that is not in accordance with this  
  Lease; 
  (l)  using glass containers in or near pools; or
  (m) conducting any kind of business (including child-care  
  services) in your apartment or in the apartment  
  community—except for any lawful business  
  conducted “at home” by computer, mail, or telephone if  
  customers, clients, patients, employees or other  
  business associates do not come to your apartment  
  for business purposes.
12.  Animals.  No living creatures of any kind are allowed, even tempo -
rarily, anywhere in the apartment or apartment community un -
less we’ve given written permission.  If we allow an animal, you must 
sign a separate Animal Addendum and, except as set forth in the ad -
dendum, pay an animal deposit and applicable fees and additional 
monthly rent, as applicable. An animal deposit is considered a gener -
al security deposit. You represent that any requests, statements and 
representations you make, including those for an assistance or sup -
port animal, are true, accurate and made in good faith. Feeding stray, 
feral or wild animals is a breach of this Lease. 
 12.1.   Removal of Unauthorized Animal. We may remove an  
 unauthorized animal by (1) leaving, in a conspicuous  
 place in the apartment, a written notice of our intent to  
 remove the animal within 24 hours; and (2) following the  
 procedures of Par. 14. We may: keep or kennel the animal;  
 turn the animal over to a humane society, local authority  
 or rescue organization; or return the animal to you if  
 we consent to your request to keep the animal and you  
 have completed and signed an Animal Addendum and  
 paid all fees. When keeping or kenneling an animal, we  
 won’t be liable for loss, harm, sickness, or death of the  
 animal unless due to our negligence. You must pay for  
 the animal’s reasonable care and kenneling charges. 
 12.2.  Violations of Animal Policies and Charges.  If you or  
 any guest or occupant violates the animal restrictions of  
 this Lease or our Community Policies, you’ll be subject to  
 charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies  
 provided in this Lease, including animal violation charges  
 listed in Lease Details from the date the animal was  
 brought into your apartment until it is removed. If an  
 animal has been in the apartment at any time during  
 your term of occupancy (with or without our consent),  
 we’ll charge you for all cleaning and repair costs,  
 including defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing. Initial  
 and daily animal-violation charges and animal-removal  
 charges are liquidated damages for our time,  
 inconvenience, and overhead in enforcing animal  
 restrictions and Community Policies. 
13.  Parking. You may not be guaranteed parking. We may regulate the 
time, manner, and place of parking of all motorized vehicles and 
other modes of transportation, including bicycles and scooters, in 
this Lease. In addition to other rights we have to tow or boot vehicles 
under state law, we also have the right to remove, at the expense of 
the vehicle owner or operator, any vehicle that is not in compliance 
with this Lease. 
14.  When We May Enter. If you or any other resident, guest or occupant 
is present, then repair or service persons, contractors, law officers, 
government representatives, lenders, appraisers, prospective resi -
dents or buyers, insurance agents, persons authorized to enter under 
your rental application, or our representatives may peacefully enter 
the apartment at reasonable times for reasonable business purposes. 
If nobody is in the apartment, then any such person may enter peace -
fully and at reasonable times (by breaking a window or other means 
when necessary) for reasonable business purposes if written notice of 
the entry is left in a conspicuous place in the apartment immediately 
after the entry. We are under no obligation to enter only when you 
are present, and we may, but are not obligated to, give prior notice or 
make appointments.

Not for use15.  Requests, Repairs and Malfunctions. 
 15.1.   Written Requests Required. If you or any occupant needs  
 to send a request—for example, for repairs, installations,  
 services, ownership disclosure, or security-related matters—  
 it must be written and delivered to our designated  
 representative in accordance with this Lease  (except for  
 fair-housing accommodation or modification requests or  
 situations involving imminent danger or threats to health or  
 safety, such as fire, smoke, gas, explosion, or crime in  
 progress). Our written notes regarding your oral request do  
 not constitute a written request from you. Our complying  
 with or responding to any oral request doesn’t waive the strict  
 requirement for written notices under this Lease. A request  
 for maintenance or repair by anyone residing in your  
 apartment constitutes a request from all residents. The time,  
 manner, method and means of performing maintenance  
 and repairs, including whether or which vendors to use,  
 are within our sole discretion.
 15.2.  Your Requirement to Notify.  You must promptly notify us in  
 writing of air conditioning or heating problems, water leaks or  
 moisture, mold, electrical problems, malfunctioning lights,  
 broken or missing locks or latches, or any other condition that  
 poses a hazard or threat to property, health, or safety. Unless  
 we instruct otherwise, you are required to keep the  
 apartment cooled or heated according to this Lease. Air  
 conditioning problems are normally not emergencies. 
 15.3.  Utilities.  We may change or install utility lines or  
 equipment serving the apartment if the work is done  
 reasonably without substantially increasing your  
 utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt  
 utilities as needed to perform work or to avoid  
 property damage or other emergencies. If utilities  
 malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar  
 cause, you must notify our representative immediately.  
 15.4.  Your Remedies.  We’ll act with customary diligence to  
 make repairs and reconnections within a reasonable  
 time, taking into consideration when casualty-insurance  
 proceeds are received. Unless required by statute after  
 a casualty loss, or during equipment repair, your Rent  
 will not abate in whole or in part. “Reasonable time”  
 accounts for the severity and nature of the problem and  
 the reasonable availability of materials, labor, and  
 utilities.  If we fail to timely repair a condition that  
 materially affects the physical health or safety of an  
 ordinary resident as required by the Texas Property Code,  
 you may be entitled to exercise remedies under § 92.056  
 and § 92.0561 of the Texas Property Code. If you follow  
 the procedures under those sections, the following  
 remedies, among others, may be available to you:  
 (1) termination of this Lease and an appropriate refund  
 under 92.056(f); (2) have the condition repaired or  
 remedied according to § 92.0561; (3) deduct from the Rent  
 the cost of the repair or remedy according to § 92.0561;  
 and 4) judicial remedies according to § 92.0563.
16.  Our Right to Terminate for Apartment Community Damage or 
Closure.  If, in our sole judgment, damages to the unit or building are 
significant or performance of needed repairs poses a danger to you, 
we may terminate this Lease and your right to possession by giving 
you at least 7 days’ written notice. If termination occurs, you agree 
we’ll refund only prorated rent and all deposits, minus lawful deduc -
tions. We may remove and dispose of your personal property if, in 
our sole judgment, it causes a health or safety hazard or impedes our 
ability to make repairs.
 16.1.  Property Closure.  We also have the right to terminate  
 this Lease and your right to possession by giving you at  
 least 30 days’ written notice of termination if we are  
 demolishing your apartment or closing it and it will no  
 longer be used for residential purposes for at least 6  
 months, or if any part of the property becomes subject to  
 an eminent domain proceeding.  
17.  Assignments and Subletting.  You may not assign this Lease or sub -
let your apartment. You agree that you won‘t rent, offer to rent or 
license all or any part of your apartment to anyone else unless other -
wise agreed to in advance by us in writing. You agree that you won‘t 
accept anything of value from anyone else for the use of any part of 
your apartment. You agree not to list any part of your apartment on 
any lodging or short-term rental website or with any person or ser -
vice that advertises dwellings for rent.
18.  Security and Safety Devices.  We’ll pay for missing security de -
vices that are required by law. You’ll pay for: (A) rekeying that 
you request (unless we failed to rekey after the previous resi -
dent moved out); and (B) repairs or replacements because of 
misuse or damage by you or your family, your occupants, or your 
guests. You must pay immediately after the work is done unless state 
law authorizes advance payment. You must also pay in advance for 
any additional or changed security devices you request. Texas Property Code secs. 92.151, 92.153, and 92.154 require, with 
some exceptions, that we provide at no cost to you when occupancy 
begins: (A) a window latch on each window; (B) a doorviewer (peep -
hole or window) on each exterior door; (C) a pin lock on each sliding 
door; (D) either a door-handle latch or a security bar on each sliding 
door; (E) a keyless bolting device (deadbolt) on each exterior door; 
and (F) either a keyed doorknob lock or a keyed deadbolt lock on 
one entry door. Keyed locks will be rekeyed after the prior resident 
moves out. The rekeying will be done either before you move in or 
within 7 days after you move in, as required by law. If we fail to in -
stall or rekey security devices as required by law, you have the right 
to do so and deduct the reasonable cost from your next Rent pay -
ment under Texas Property Code sec. 92.165(1). We may deactivate 
or not install keyless bolting devices on your doors if (A) you or an 
occupant in the dwelling is over 55 or disabled, and (B) the require -
ments of Texas Property Code sec. 92.153(e) or (f) are satisfied. 
 18.1.   Smoke Alarms and Detection Devices. We’ll furnish  
 smoke alarms or other detection devices required by law  
 or city ordinance. We may install additional detectors  
 not so required. We’ll test them and provide working  
 batteries when you first take possession of your  
 apartment. Upon request, we’ll provide, as required by  
 law, a smoke alarm capable of alerting a person with a  
 hearing impairment. 
  You must pay for and replace batteries as needed,  
 unless the law provides otherwise. We may replace dead  
 or missing batteries at your expense, without prior notice  
 to you. Neither you nor your guests or occupants may  
 disable alarms or detectors. If you damage or disable the  
 smoke alarm or remove a battery without replacing it  
 with a working battery, you may be liable to us under  
 Texas Property Code sec. 92.2611 for $100 plus one  
 month’s Rent, actual damages, and attorney’s fees.  
 18.2.   Duty to Report. You must immediately report to us any  
 missing, malfunctioning or defective security devices,  
 smoke alarms or detectors. You’ll be liable if you fail to  
 report malfunctions, or fail to report any loss, damage, or  
 fines resulting from fire, smoke, or water.
19.  Resident Safety and Loss.  Unless otherwise required by law, none 
of us, our employees, agents, or management companies are liable 
to you, your guests or occupants for any damage, personal injury, 
loss to personal property, or loss of business or personal income, 
from any cause, including but not limited to: negligent or intention -
al acts of residents, occupants, or guests; theft, burglary, assault, 
vandalism or other crimes; fire, flood, water leaks, rain, hail, ice, 
snow, smoke, lightning, wind, explosions, interruption of utilities, 
pipe leaks or other occurrences unless such damage, injury or loss is 
caused exclusively by our negligence. 
 We do not warrant security of any kind. You agree that you will not 
rely upon any security measures taken by us for personal security, 
and that you will call 911 and local law enforcement authorities if any 
security needs arise.
 You acknowledge that we are not equipped or trained to provide 
personal security services to you, your guests or occupants. You rec -
ognize that we are not required to provide any private security ser -
vices and that no security devices or measures on the property are 
fail-safe. You further acknowledge that, even if an alarm or gate ame -
nities are provided, they are mechanical devices that can malfunc -
tion. Any charges resulting from the use of an intrusion alarm will be 
charged to you, including, but not limited to, any false alarms with 
police/fire/ambulance response or other required city charges.
20.   Condition of the Premises and Alterations. 
 20.1.   As-Is. We disclaim all implied warranties. You accept the  
 apartment, fixtures, and furniture as is, except for  
 conditions materially affecting the health or safety of  
 ordinary persons. You’ll be given an Inventory and  
 Condition Form at or before move-in. You agree that  
 after completion of the form or within 48 hours  after  
 move-in, whichever comes first, you must note on the  
 form all defects or damage, sign the form, return it to  
 us, and the form accurately reflects the condition of the  
 premises for purposes of determining any refund due to  
 you when you move out. Otherwise, everything will be  
 considered to be in a clean, safe, and good working  
 condition. You must still send a separate request for any  
 repairs needed as provided by Par. 15.1.
 20.2.   Standards and Improvements. Unless authorized by  
 law or by us in writing, you must not perform any repairs,  
 painting, wallpapering, carpeting, electrical changes, or  
 otherwise alter our property. No holes or stickers are  
 allowed inside or outside the apartment. Unless this Lease  
 states otherwise, we’ll permit a reasonable number of small  
 nail holes for hanging pictures on sheetrock walls and in  
 grooves of wood-paneled walls. No water furniture, washing  
 machines, dryers, extra phone or television outlets, alarm  
 systems, cameras, two-way talk device, video or other door __

Apartment Lease Contract ©2023, Texas Apartment Association, Inc.                                                                                               Page 5 of 6 bells, or lock changes, additions, or rekeying is permitted  
 unless required by law or we’ve consented in writing. You may  
 install a satellite dish or antenna, but only if you sign our  
 satellite dish or antenna lease addendum, which complies  
 with reasonable restrictions allowed by federal law. You must  
 not alter, damage, or remove our property, including alarm  
 systems, detection devices, appliances, furniture, telephone  
 and television wiring, screens, locks, or security devices. When  
 you move in, we’ll supply light bulbs for fixtures we furnish,  
 including exterior fixtures operated from inside the  
 apartment; after that, you’ll replace them at your expense  
 with bulbs of the same type and wattage. Your improvements  
 to the apartment (made with or without our consent) become  
 ours unless we agree otherwise in writing.
21. Notices.  Written notice to or from our employees, agents, or  
management companies constitutes notice to or from us. Notices to 
you or any other resident of the apartment constitute notice to all 
residents. Notices and requests from any resident constitute notice 
from all residents. Only residents can give notice of Lease termination 
and intent to move out under Par. 7.3. All notices and documents will 
be in English and, at our option, in any other language that you read 
or speak.
 21.1.  Electronic Notice.  Notice may be given electronically by  
 us to you  if allowed by law. If allowed by law and in  
 accordance with this Lease, electronic notice from you to us   
 must be sent to the email address and/or portal specified in  
 this Lease. Notice may also be given by phone call or to a  
 physical address if allowed in this Lease. 
  You represent that you have provided your current email  
 address to us, and that you will notify us in the event your  
 email address changes.
EVICTION AND REMEDIES
22. Liability.  Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all Lease  
obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates this Lease or our 
Community Policies, all residents are considered to have violated this 
Lease. 
 22.1.  Indemnification by You.  You’ll defend, indemnify and hold us  
 and our employees, agents, and management company  
 harmless from all liability arising from your conduct or  
 requests to our representatives and from the conduct of or  
 requests by your invitees, occupants or guests. 
23. Default by Resident. 
 23.1. Acts of Default.  You’ll be in default if: (A) you don’t  
 timely pay Rent, including monthly recurring charges, or  
 other amounts you owe; (B) you or any guest or  
 occupant violates this Lease, our Community Policies,  
 or fire, safety, health, criminal or other laws, regardless of  
 whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (C) you  
 give incorrect, incomplete, or false answers in a rental  
 application or in this Lease; or (D) you or any occupant is  
 charged, detained, convicted, or given deferred  
 adjudication or pretrial diversion for (1) an offense  
 involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or  
 involving the manufacture or delivery of a controlled  
 substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia as defined  
 in the Texas Controlled Substances Act, or (2) any sex-  
 related crime, including a misdemeanor.
 23.2. Eviction. If you default, including holding over, we may  
 end your right of occupancy by giving you at least a 24-  
 hour written notice to vacate.  Termination of your possession  
 rights doesn’t release you from liability for future Rent or  
 other Lease obligations. After giving notice to vacate or  
 filing an eviction suit, we may still accept Rent or other  
 sums due; the filing or acceptance doesn’t waive or  
 diminish our right of eviction or any other contractual or  
 statutory right.  Accepting money at any time doesn’t waive  
 our right to damages, to past or future Rent or other sums,  
 or to our continuing with eviction proceedings. In an eviction,  
 Rent is owed for the full rental period and will not be  
 prorated. 
 23.3.  Acceleration.  Unless we elect not to accelerate Rent, all  
 monthly Rent for the rest of the Lease term or renewal  
 period will be accelerated automatically without notice  
 or demand (before or after acceleration) and will be  
 immediately due if, without our written consent: (A) you  
 move out, remove property in preparing to move out,  
 or you or any occupant gives oral or written notice of  
 intent to move out before the Lease term or renewal  
 period ends; and (B) you haven’t paid all Rent for the  
 entire Lease term or renewal period. Remaining Rent will  
 also be accelerated if you’re judicially evicted or move  
 out when we demand because you’ve defaulted.
   If you don’t pay the first month’s Rent when or before this Lease  
 begins, all future Rent for the Lease term will be automatically  
 accelerated without notice and become immediately due. We  
 also may end your right of occupancy and recover damages,  
 future Rent, attorney’s fees, court costs, and other lawful charges.  
 23.4. Holdover. You and all occupants must vacate and surrender  
 the apartment by or before the date contained in: (1) your  
 move-out notice (2) our notice to vacate, (3) our notice of  
 non-renewal, or (4) a written agreement specifying a different  
 move-out date. If a holdover occurs, then you’ll be liable to us  
 for all Rent for the full term of the previously signed lease of a  
 new resident who can’t occupy because of the holdover, and  
 at our option, we may extend the Lease term and/or increase  
 the Rent by 25% by delivering written notice to you or your  
 apartment while you continue to hold over.
 23.5. Other Remedies.  We may report unpaid amounts to  
 credit agencies as allowed by law. If we or our debt  
 collector tries to collect any money you owe us, you  
 agree that we or the debt collector may contact you by  
 any legal means. If you default, you will pay us, in addition  
 to other sums due, any rental discounts or concessions  
 agreed to in writing that have been applied to your account.  
 We may recover attorney’s fees in connection with enforcing  
 our rights under this Lease. All unpaid amounts you owe bear  
 interest at the rate provided by Texas Finance Code Section  
 304.003(c) from the due date. You must pay all collection-  
 agency fees if you fail to pay sums due within 10 days after  
 you are mailed a letter demanding payment and stating that  
 collection-agency fees will be added if you don’t pay all sums  
 by that deadline. You are also liable for a charge (not to  
 exceed $150) to cover our time, cost and expense for any  
 eviction proceeding against you, plus our attorney’s fees and  
 expenses, court costs, and filing fees actually paid.
24.  Representatives’ Authority and Waivers.  Our representatives (in -
cluding management personnel, employees, and agents) have no 
authority to waive, amend, or terminate this Lease or any part of it 
unless in writing and signed, and no authority to make promises, rep -
resentations, or agreements that impose security duties or other ob -
ligations on us or our representatives, unless in writing and signed. 
No action or omission by us will be considered a waiver of our rights or of 
any subsequent violation, default, or time or place of performance. Our 
choice to enforce, not enforce or delay enforcement of written-no -
tice requirements, rental due dates, acceleration, liens, or any other 
rights isn’t a waiver under any circumstances. Delay in demanding 
sums you owe is not a waiver. Except when notice or demand is required 
by law, you waive any notice and demand for performance from us if you 
default. Nothing in this Lease constitutes a waiver of our remedies for a 
breach under your prior lease that occurred before the Lease term begins. 
Your Lease is subordinate to existing and future recorded mortgages, un -
less the owner’s lender chooses otherwise.
 All remedies are cumulative. Exercising one remedy won’t constitute 
an election or waiver of other remedies. All provisions regarding our 
nonliability or nonduty apply to our employees, agents, and manage -
ment companies. No employee, agent, or management company is 
personally liable for any of our contractual, statutory, or other obliga -
tions merely by virtue of acting on our behalf.  
END OF THE LEASE TERM
25. Move-Out Notice.  Before moving out, you must give our represen -
tative advance written move-out notice as stated in Par. 4, even if 
this Lease has become a month-to-month lease.  The move-out date 
can’t be changed unless we and you both agree in writing.
 Your move-out notice must comply with each of the following:
 (a) Unless we require more than 30 days’ notice, if you give  
 notice on the first day of the month you intend to move  
 out, move out will be on the last day of that month.
 (b) Your move-out notice must not terminate this Lease  
 before the end of the Lease term or renewal period.
 (c) If we require you to give us more than 30 days’ written  
 notice to move out before the end of the Lease term, we  
 will give you 1 written reminder not less than 5 days nor  
 more than 90 days before your deadline for giving us  
 your written move-out notice. If we fail to give a reminder  
 notice, 30 days’ written notice to move out is required.
 (d) You must get from us a written acknowledgment of your  
 notice.
26. Move-Out Procedures. 
 26. 1.  Cleaning.  You must thoroughly clean the apartment, including  
 doors, windows, furniture, bathrooms, kitchen appliances,  
 patios, balconies, garages, carports, and storage rooms. You  
 must follow move-out cleaning instructions if they have been  
 provided. If you don’t clean adequately, you’ll be liable for  
 reasonable cleaning charges—including charges for cleaning  
 carpets, draperies, furniture, walls, etc. that are soiled beyond

 negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse).
 26.2.  Move-Out Inspection.  We may, but are not obligated to,  
 provide a joint move-out inspection.  Our representatives  
 have no authority to bind or limit us regarding deductions for  
 repairs, damages, or charges. Any statements or estimates by  
 us or our representative are subject to our correction, modi-  
 fication, or disapproval before final accounting or refunding.
27. Surrender and Abandonment.  You have surrendered  the apartment 
when: (A) the move-out date has passed and no one is living in the 
apartment in our reasonable judgment; or (B) apartment keys and ac -
cess devices listed in Par. 2.1 have been turned in to us—whichever 
happens first. 
 You have abandoned  the apartment when all of the following have 
occurred: (A) everyone appears to have moved out in our reasonable 
judgment; (B) you’ve been in default for nonpayment of Rent for 5 
consecutive days, or water, gas, or electric service for the apartment 
not connected in our name has been terminated or transferred; and  
(C) you’ve not responded for 2 days to our notice left on the inside of 
the main entry door stating that we consider the apartment aban -
doned. An apartment is also considered abandoned 10 days after the 
death of a sole resident.
 27.1.  The Ending of Your Rights.  Surrender, abandonment, or  
 judicial eviction ends your right of possession for all purposes  
 and gives us the immediate right to clean up, make repairs in,  
 and relet the apartment; determine any security-deposit  
 deductions; and remove or store property left in the apartment. 
 27.2.   Removal and Storage of Property.  We, or law officers, may—  
 but have no duty to—remove or store all property that in our  
 sole judgment belongs to you and remains in the apartment  
 or in common areas (including any vehicles you or any  
 occupant or guest owns or uses) after you’re judicially evicted  
 or if you surrender or abandon the apartment.
  We’re not liable for casualty, loss, damage, or theft. You  
 must pay reasonable charges for our packing, removing and  
 storing any property. 
  Except for animals, we may throw away or give to a charitable  
 organization all personal property that is: 
  (1)  left in the apartment after surrender or abandonment; or 
  (2)  left outside more than 1 hour after writ of possession is  
        executed, following judicial eviction.
  An animal removed after surrender, abandonment, or eviction  
 may be kenneled or turned over to a local authority, humane  
 society, or rescue organization.  
GENERAL PROVISIONS AND SIGNATURES
28. TAA Membership. We, the management company representing us, 
or any locator service that you used confirms membership in good 
standing of both the Texas Apartment Association and the affiliated 
local apartment association for the area where the apartment is  
located at the time of signing this Lease. If not, the following applies: 
(A) this Lease is voidable at your option and is unenforceable by us 
(except for property damages); and (B) we may not recover past or 
future rent or other charges. The above remedies also apply if both 
of the following occur: (1) this Lease is automatically renewed on a 
month-to-month basis more than once after membership in TAA and 
the local association has lapsed; and (2) neither the owner nor the man -
agement company is a member of TAA and the local association during 
the third automatic renewal. A signed affidavit from the affiliated local 
apartment association attesting to nonmembership when this Lease 
or renewal was signed will be conclusive evidence of nonmembership. 
Governmental entities may use TAA forms if TAA agrees in writing.

 represent, join or otherwise maintain a class action,  
 collective action or similar proceeding against us in  
 any forum.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, WITHOUT THIS WAIVER, YOU

 terrorism, riots, flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, sabotage or
