FLOOD DISCLOSURE NOTICE
In accordance with Texas law, we are providing the following flood disclosure:
•Weareor arenot aware that the unit you are renting is located in a 100 -year floodplain. If
neither box is checked, you should assume the unit is in a 100- year floodplain. Even if the unit is not
in a 100- year floodplain, the unit may still be susceptible to flooding. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) maintains a flood map on its Internet website that is searchable by
address, at no cost, to determine if a unit is located in a flood hazard area. Most renter’s insurance
policies do not cover damages or loss incurred in a flood. You should seek insurance coverage that
would cover losses caused by a flood.
•We are or are not aware that the unityou are renting has flooded (per the statutory definition
below) at least once within the last five years.
As defined in Texas Property Code 92.0135(a)(2) , “flooding” means “a general or temporary 
condition of a partial or complete inundation of a dwelling caused by: (A) the overflow of inland or tidal waters; (B) the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any established water source such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch; or (C) excessive rainfall. ”

©2019 Texas  apar Tmen T associa Tion, inc.  con Tinued  on backBed Bug Addendum
1.  Addendum.  This is an addendum to the Lease Contract that you, 
the resident or residents, signed on the dwelling you have agreed 
to rent. That dwelling is: 
  Apt. #                 at    
  
  
  
  
(name of apartments )
  or other dwelling located at   
  
  (street address of house, duplex, etc. ) 
    (city)
                      (state )   (zip).
2. Purpose.  This addendum modifies the Lease Contract to address 
any infestation of bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) that might be found 
in the dwelling or on your personal property. We will rely on repre -
sentations that you make to us in this addendum.
3. Inspection and Infestations.  We are not aware of any current 
evidence of bed bugs or bed-bug infestation in the dwelling.  
 
BY SIGNING THIS ADDENDUM, YOU REPRESENT THAT:
• YOU HAVE INSPECTED THE DWELLING BEFORE MOVING 
IN OR SIGNING THIS ADDENDUM, AND YOU DID NOT 
FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF BED BUGS OR BED-BUG INFES -
TATIONS, OR
• YOU WILL INSPECT THE DWELLING WITHIN 48 HOURS 
AFTER MOVING IN OR SIGNING THIS ADDENDUM AND 
WILL NOTIFY US OF ANY BED BUGS OR BED-BUG INFES -
TATION.
You represent and agree that you have read the information about 
bed bugs provided by us and that you are not aware of any infesta -
tion or presence of bed bugs in your current or previous dwellings, 
furniture, clothing, personal property and possessions and that you 
have fully disclosed to us any previous bed-bug infestation or issue 
that you have experienced. 
If you disclose a previous experience of bed-bug infestation, we can 
review documentation of the treatment and inspect your personal 
property and possessions to confirm the absence of bed bugs. 
4.  Access for Inspection and Pest Treatment.  You must allow us 
and our pest-control agents access to the dwelling at reasonable 
times to inspect for or treat bed bugs. You and your family mem -
bers, occupants, guests, and invitees must cooperate and not in -
terfere with inspections or treatments. We have the right to select 
any licensed pest-control professional to treat the dwelling and 
building. We can select the method of treating the dwelling, build -
ing, and common areas for bed bugs. We can also inspect and treat 
adjacent or neighboring dwellings to the infestation, even if those 
dwellings are not the source or cause of the known infestation. Si -
multaneously as we treat the dwelling, you must, at your expense, 
have your personal property, furniture, clothing, and possessions 
treated according to accepted treatment methods by a licensed 
pest-control firm that we approve. If you fail to do so, you will be 
in default and we will have the right to terminate your right of oc -
cupancy and exercise all rights and remedies under the Lease Con -
tract. You agree not to treat the dwelling for a bed-bug infestation 
on your own.5.  Notification.  You must promptly notify us:
•  of any known or suspected bed-bug infestation or presence in 
the dwelling, or in any of your clothing, furniture, or personal 
property;
•  of any recurring or unexplained bites, stings, irritations, or 
sores on the skin or body that you believe are caused by bed 
bugs, or by any condition or pest you believe is in the dwelling; 
  AND
•  if you discover any condition or evidence that might indicate 
the presence or infestation of bed bugs, or if you receive any 
confirmation of bed-bug presence by a licensed pest-control 
professional or other authoritative source.
6.  Cooperation.  If we confirm the presence or infestation of bed 
bugs, you must cooperate and coordinate with us and our pest-
control agents to treat and eliminate them. You must follow all di -
rections from us or our agents to clean and treat the dwelling and 
building that are infested. You must remove or destroy personal 
property that cannot be treated or cleaned before we treat the 
dwelling. Any items you remove from the dwelling must be dis -
posed of off-site and not in the property’s trash receptacles. If we 
confirm the presence or infestation of bed bugs in your dwelling, 
we have the right to require you to temporarily vacate the dwelling 
and remove all furniture, clothing, and personal belongings so we 
can perform pest-control services. If you don’t cooperate with us, 
you will be in default and we will have the right to terminate your 
right of occupancy and exercise all rights and remedies under the 
Lease Contract.
7.  Responsibilities.  You may be required to pay all reasonable costs 
of cleaning and pest-control treatments incurred by us to treat 
your dwelling unit for bed bugs. If we confirm the presence or in -
festation of bed bugs after you move out, you may be responsible 
for the cost of cleaning and pest control. If we have to move other 
residents in order to treat adjoining or neighboring dwellings to 
your dwelling unit, you may have to pay any lost rental income and 
other expenses we incur to relocate the neighboring residents and 
to clean and perform pest-control treatments to eradicate infesta -
tions in other dwellings. If you don’t pay us for any costs you are 
liable for, you will be in default and we will have the right to termi -
nate your right of occupancy and exercise all rights and remedies 
under the Lease Contract, and we may take immediate possession 
of the dwelling. If you don’t move out after your right of occupancy 
has been terminated, you will be liable for holdover rent under the 
Lease Contract.
8.  Transfers.  If we allow you to transfer to another dwelling in the 
community because of the presence of bed bugs, you must have 
your personal property and possessions treated according to ac -
cepted treatment methods or procedures established by a licensed 
pest-control professional. You must provide proof of such cleaning 
and treatment to our satisfaction.Please note: We want to maintain a high-quality living environment for you. It’s important to work together to 
minimize the potential for bed bugs in your dwelling and others. This addendum outlines your responsibility 
and potential liability when it comes to bed bugs. It also gives you some important information about them.
You are entitled to receive a copy of this Addendum after it is fully signed. Keep it in a safe place.You are legally bound by this document. Please read it carefully.

TAA Official Statewide Form 19-JJ, Revised October 2019
Copyright 2019, Texas Apartment Association, Inc.
Bed bugs are wingless, flat, broadly oval-shaped in -
sects, with a typical lifespan of 6 to 12 months. Capa -
ble of reaching the size of an apple seed at full growth, 
bed bugs are distinguishable by their reddish-brown 
color, although after feeding on the blood of hu -
mans and warm-blooded animals—their sole food 
source—the bugs assume a distinctly blood-red hue 
until digestion is complete.
Bed bugs don’t discriminate.
Bed bugs’ increased presence across the United States 
in recent decades is due largely to a surge in interna -
tional travel and trade. It’s no surprise then that bed 
bugs have been found in some of the fanciest hotels 
and apartment buildings in some of the nation’s most 
expensive neighborhoods.
Nonetheless, false claims that associate bed bugs 
presence with poor hygiene and uncleanliness have 
caused rental-housing residents, out of shame, to 
avoid notifying owners of their presence. This only 
causes the bed bugs to spread.
While bed bugs are more attracted to clutter, they’re 
certainly not discouraged by cleanliness. Bottom line: 
bed bugs know no social or economic bounds; claims 
to the contrary are false.
Bed bugs don’t 
transmit disease.
There exists no scientific evidence that bed bugs 
carry disease. In fact, federal agencies tasked with 
addressing pests of public-health concern, namely 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have re -
fused to elevate bed bugs to the threat level posed by 
disease-carrying pests. Again, claims associating bed 
bugs with disease are false.
Learn to identify bed bugs.
Bed bugs can often be found in, around, behind, un -
der, or between:
•  Bedding
•  Bed frames
•  Mattress seams
•  Upholstered furniture, especially under cushions 
and along seams
•  Wood furniture, especially along areas where draw -
ers slide
•  Curtains and draperies
•  Window and door frames
•  Ceiling and wall junctions
•  Crown moldings
•  Wall hangings and loose wallpaper
•  Carpeting and walls (carpet can be pulled away from 
the wall and tack strip)
•  Cracks and crevices in walls and floors
•  Electronic devices, such as smoke and carbon-mon -
oxide detectors
Because bed bugs leave some people with itchy welts 
similar to those made by fleas and mosquitoes, the Bed Bugs
A Guide for Rental-Housing Residents
(Adapted with permission from the National Apartment Association )
cause of welts like that often go misdiagnosed. One 
distinguishing sign is that bed-bug marks often ap -
pear in succession on exposed areas of the skin such 
as the face, neck, and arms.  But sometimes a person 
has no visible reaction at all from direct contact with 
bed bugs.
While bed bugs typically act at night, they often 
leave signs of their presence through fecal markings 
of a red to dark-brown color, visible on or near beds. 
Blood stains also tend to appear when the bugs have 
been squashed, usually by an unsuspecting sleeping 
host. And because they shed, it’s not uncommon to 
find the skin casts they leave behind.
Prevent bed-bug encounters 
when traveling.
Because humans serve as bed bugs’ main mode of 
transportation, it’s especially important to be mindful 
of bed bugs when away from home. Experts attribute 
the spread of bed bugs across all regions of the Unit -
ed States largely to increases in travel and trade, both 
here and abroad. So travelers are encouraged to take 
a few minutes on arriving to thoroughly inspect their 
accommodations before unpacking. Because bed 
bugs can easily travel from one place to another, it’s 
also a good practice to thoroughly inspect luggage 
and belongings for bed bugs before heading home.
Know the bed-bug 
dos and don’ts.
•  Don’t  bring used furniture from unknown sourc -
es into your dwelling. Countless bed-bug infesta -
tions have stemmed directly from bringing home 
second-hand and abandoned furniture. Unless 
you are absolutely sure that a piece of second-
hand furniture is bed-bug-free, you should as -
sume that a seemingly nice looking leather 
couch, for example, is sitting curbside waiting to 
be hauled off to the landfill because it’s teeming 
with bed bugs.
• Do inspect rental furniture, including mattresses 
and couches, for the presence of bed bugs before 
moving it into your dwelling.
• Do address bed-bug sightings immediately. Rent -
al-housing residents who suspect the presence of 
bed bugs in their unit must immediately notify 
the owner.
• Don’t  try to treat bed-bug infestations yourself. 
Health hazards associated with the misapplica -
tion of traditional and nontraditional chemical-
based insecticides and pesticides poses too 
great a risk to you, your family and pets, and your 
neighbors.
• Do comply with eradication protocol. If the deter -
mination is made that your unit is indeed playing 
host to bed bugs, you must comply with the bed-
bug-eradication protocol set forth by both your 
owner and their designated pest-management 
company.

Apartment Lease Contract ©2022, Texas Apartment Association, Inc.                                                                                                                 Page 2 of 6LEASE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. Definitions. The following terms are commonly used in this Lease: 
 1.1.  “Residents”  are those listed in “Residents” above who sign  
 the Lease and are authorized to live in the apartment. 
 1.2.  “Occupants”  are those listed in this Lease who are also autho-  
 rized to live in the apartment, but who do not sign the Lease. 
 1.3.  “Owner”  may be identified by an assumed name and is the  
 owner only and not property managers or anyone else. 
 1.4.  “Including”  in this Lease means “including but not limited to.” 
 1.5.  “Community Policies”  are the written apartment rules and  
 policies, including property signage and instructions for  
 care of our property and amenities, with which you, your  
 occupants, and your guests must comply. 
 1.6.  “Rent”  is monthly base rent plus additional monthly  
 recurring fixed charges.
2.  Apartment. You are leasing the apartment listed above for use as a 
private residence only.
 2.1.  Access. In accordance with our Community Policies, you’ll  
 receive access information or devices for your apartment  
 and mailbox, and other access devices including: __________  
 _______________________________________________  
 ______________________________________________. 
 2.2.  Measurements.  Any dimensions and sizes provided to you  
 relating to the apartment are only approximations or  
 estimates; actual dimensions and sizes may vary.
 2.3.  Representations. You agree that designations or accredi-  
 tations associated with the property are subject to change.
3.  Rent. You must pay your Rent on or before the 1st day of each 
month (due date) without demand. There are no exceptions  
regarding the payment of Rent, and you agree not paying Rent on 
or before the 1st of each month is a material breach of this Lease. 
 3.1.  Payments. You will pay your Rent by any method, manner  
 and place we specify in accordance with our Community  
 Policies. Cash is not acceptable without our prior written  
 permission. You cannot withhold or offset Rent unless  
 authorized by law.  We may, at our option, require at any  
 time that you pay Rent and other sums due in one single  
 payment by any method we specify.
 3.2.  Application of Payments.  Payment of each sum due is an  
 independent covenant, which means payments are due  
 regardless of our performance.  When we receive money,  
 other than water and wastewater payments subject to  
 government regulation, we may apply it at our option and  
 without notice first to any of your unpaid obligations, then  
 to accrued rent. We may do so regardless of notations on  
 checks or money orders and regardless of when the  
 obligations arose. All sums other than Rent and late fees are  
 due upon our demand. After the due date, we do not have  
 to accept any payments.
 3.3.  Late Fees.  If we don’t receive your monthly base rent in full  
 when it’s due, you must pay late fees as outlined in Lease Details.
 3.4.  Returned Payment Fee.  You’ll pay the fee listed in Lease  
 Details for each returned check or rejected electronic  
 payment, plus initial and daily late fees if applicable, until  
 we receive full payment in an acceptable method. 
 3.5.  Utilities and Services.  You’ll pay for all utilities and services,  
 related deposits, and any charges or fees when they are due  
 and as outlined in this Lease. Television channels that are  
 provided may be changed during the Lease term if the  
 change applies to all residents.
  If your electricity is interrupted, you must use only battery-  
 operated lighting (no flames). You must not allow any  
 utilities (other than cable or Internet) to be cut off or  
 switched for any reason—including disconnection for not  
 paying your bills—until the Lease term or renewal period  
 ends. If a utility is individually metered, it must be connected  
 in your name and you must notify the provider of your move-  
 out date. If you delay getting service turned on in your name  
 by the Lease’s start date or cause it to be transferred back into  
 our name before you surrender or abandon the apartment,  
 you’ll be liable for the charge listed above (not to exceed $50  
 per billing period), plus the actual or estimated cost of the  
 utilities used while the utility should have been billed to you.  
 If your apartment is individually metered and you change  
 your retail electric provider, you must give us written notice.  
 You must pay all applicable provider fees, including any fees  
 to change service back into our name after you move out.
 3.6.  Lease Changes.  Lease changes are only allowed during the  
 Lease term or renewal period if governed by Par. 10, specified  
 in Special Provisions in Par. 32, or by a written addendum or  
 amendment signed by you and us. At or after the end of the  
 initial Lease term, Rent increases will become effective with at  
 least 5 days plus the number of days’ advance notice contained  
 in Box F on page 1 in writing from us to you. Your new Lease,  
 which may include increased Rent or Lease changes, will begin  
 on the date stated in any advance notice we provide (without  
 needing your signature) unless you give us written move-out  
 notice under Par. 25, which applies only to the end of the current  
 Lease term or renewal period.4.  Automatic Lease Renewal and Notice of Termination. This Lease 
will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives 
written notice of termination or intent to move out as required by Par. 
25 and specified on page 1. If the number of days isn’t filled in, no -
tice of at least 30 days is required.   
5.  Security Deposit. The total security deposit for all residents is due 
on or before the date this Lease is signed. Any animal deposit will be 
designated in an animal addendum. Security deposits may not be ap -
plied to Rent without our prior written consent. 
 5.1.  Refunds and Deductions.  You must give us your advance  
 notice of move out as provided by Par. 25 and forwarding  
 address in writing to receive a written description and  
 itemized list of charges or refund.  In accordance with our  
 Community Policies and as allowed by law, we may deduct  
 from your security deposit any amounts due under the  
 Lease. If you move out early or in response to a notice to  
 vacate, you’ll be liable for rekeying charges.  Upon receipt of  
 your move-out date and forwarding address in writing, the  
 security deposit will be returned (less lawful deductions)  
 with an itemized accounting of any deductions, no later than  
 30 days after surrender or abandonment, unless laws provide  
 otherwise. Any refund may be by one payment jointly payable  
 to all residents and distributed to any one resident we choose,   
 or distributed equally among all residents. 
6.  Insurance. Our insurance doesn’t cover the loss of or damage to 
your personal property.  You will be required to have liability insur -
ance as specified in our Community Policies or Lease addenda un -
less otherwise prohibited by law. If you have insurance covering the 
apartment or your personal belongings at the time you or we suffer 
or allege a loss, you agree to require your insurance carrier to waive 
any insurance subrogation rights. Even if not required, we urge you 
to obtain your own insurance for losses due to theft, fire, flood, water, 
pipe leaks and similar occurrences.  Most renter’s insurance policies 
don’t cover losses due to a flood.
7.  Reletting and Early Lease Termination.  This Lease may not be ter -
minated early except as provided in this Lease.
 7.1. Reletting Charge. You’ll be liable for a reletting charge as  
 listed in Lease Details, (not to exceed 85% of the highest  
 monthly Rent during the Lease term) if you: (A) fail to move in,  
 or fail to give written move-out notice as required in Par. 25;  
 (B) move out without paying Rent in full for the entire Lease  
 term or renewal period; (C) move out at our demand because  
 of your default; or (D) are judicially evicted. The reletting  
 charge is not a termination, cancellation or buyout fee and  
 does not release you from your obligations under this Lease,  
 including liability for future or past-due Rent, charges for  
 damages or other sums due.
  The reletting charge is a liquidated amount covering only  
 part of our damages—for our time, effort, and expense in  
 finding and processing a replacement resident. These  
 damages are uncertain and hard to ascertain—particularly  
 those relating to inconvenience, paperwork, advertising,  
 showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking pros-  
 pects, overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees.  
 You agree that the reletting charge is a reasonable estimate  
 of our damages and that the charge is due whether or not our  
 reletting attempts succeed. 
 7.2.  Early Lease Termination Procedures. In addition to your  
 termination rights referred to in 7.3 or 8.1 below,  if this provision  
 applies under Lease Details, you may terminate the Lease  
 prior to the end of the Lease term if all of the following  
 occur:  (a) as outlined in Lease Details, you give us written  
 notice of early termination, pay the early termination fee and  
 specify the date by which you’ll move out; (b) you are not in  
 default at any time and do not hold over; and (c) you repay all  
 rent concessions, credits or discounts you received during the  
 Lease term. If you are in default, the Lease remedies apply.
 7.3.  Special Termination Rights. You may have the right under  
 Texas law to terminate the Lease early in certain situations  
 involving military deployment or transfer, family violence,  
 certain sexual offenses, stalking or death of a sole resident.  
8. Delay of Occupancy. We are not responsible for any delay of your 
occupancy caused by construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous 
resident’s holding over. This Lease will remain in force subject to  
(1) abatement of Rent on a daily basis during delay, and  (2) your right 
to terminate the Lease in writing as set forth below. Rent abatement 
and Lease termination do not apply if the delay is for cleaning or re -
pairs that don’t prevent you from moving into the apartment. 
 8.1.  Termination.  If we give written notice to you of a delay in  
 occupancy when or after the Lease begins, you may termi-  
 nate the Lease within 3 days after you receive written notice.
  If we give you written notice before the date the Lease begins  
 and the notice states that a construction or other delay is  
 expected and that the apartment will be ready for you to  
 occupy on a specific date, you may terminate the Lease within  
 7 days after receiving written notice.
  After proper termination, you are entitled only to refund of  
 any deposit(s) and any Rent you paid.

Apartment Lease Contract ©2022, Texas Apartment Association, Inc.                                                                                                                    Page 3 of 69.  Care of Unit and Damages. You must promptly pay or reimburse 
us for loss, damage, consequential damages, government fines or 
charges, or cost of repairs or service in the apartment community 
because of a Lease or Community Policies violation; improper use, 
negligence, or other conduct by you, your invitees, your occupants, 
or your guests; or, as allowed by law, any other cause not due to our 
negligence or fault, except for damages by acts of God to the extent 
they couldn’t be mitigated by your action or inaction. 
 Unless damage or wastewater stoppage is due to our negligence, 
we’re not liable for—and you must pay for—repairs and replace -
ments occurring during the Lease term or renewal period, includ -
ing: (A) damage from wastewater stoppages caused by improper 
objects in lines exclusively serving your apartment; (B) damage to 
doors, windows, or screens; and (C) damage from windows or doors 
left open. 
RESIDENT LIFE
10.  Community Policies.  Community Policies become part of the 
Lease and must be followed. We may make changes, including addi -
tions, to our written Community Policies, and those changes can be -
come effective immediately if the Community Policies are distributed 
and applicable to all units in the apartment community and do not 
change the dollar amounts in Lease Details. 
 10.1.  Photo/Video Release. You give us permission to use any  
 photograph, likeness, image or video taken of you while  
 you are using property common areas or participating in  
 any event sponsored by us. 
 10.2.  Disclosure of Information.  At our sole option, we may,  
 but are not obligated to, share and use information related  
 to this Lease for law-enforcement, governmental, or business  
 purposes. At our request, you authorize any utility provider to  
 give us information about pending or actual connections or  
 disconnections of utility service to your apartment.
 10.3.  Guests.  We may exclude from the apartment community  
 any guests or others who, in our sole judgment, have been  
 violating the law, violating this Lease or our Community  
 Policies, or disturbing other residents, neighbors, visitors,  
 or owner representatives. We may also exclude from any  
 outside area or common area anyone who refuses to show  
 photo identification or refuses to identify himself or  
 herself as a resident, an authorized occupant, or a guest of  
 a specific resident in the community.
  Anyone not listed in this Lease cannot stay in the  
 apartment for more than _______ days in one week  
 without our prior written consent, and no more than twice  
 that many days in any one month. If the previous space  
 isn’t filled in, 2 days total per week will be the limit.
 10.4.  Notice of Convictions and Registration. You must  
 notify us within 15 days if you or any of your occupants:  
 (A) are convicted of any felony, (B) are convicted of any  
 misdemeanor involving a controlled substance, violence to  
 another person, or destruction of property, or (C) register as a  
 sex offender. Informing us of a criminal conviction or  
 sex-offender registration doesn’t waive any rights we may  
 have against you.
 10.5.  Odors and Noise. You agree that odors, smoke and  
 smells including those related to cooking and everyday  
 noises or sounds are all a normal part of a multifamily  
 living environment and that it is impractical for us to  
 prevent them from penetrating your apartment.
11.  Conduct. You agree to communicate and conduct yourself in a law -
ful, courteous and reasonable manner at all times when interacting 
with us, our representatives and other residents or occupants. Any 
acts of unlawful, discourteous or unreasonable communication or 
conduct by you, your occupants or guests is a breach of this Lease.
 You must use customary diligence in maintaining the apartment, 
keeping it in a sanitary condition and not damaging or littering the 
common areas. Trash must be disposed of at least weekly. You will 
use your apartment and all other areas, including any balconies, with 
reasonable care. We may regulate the use of passageways, patios, 
balconies, porches, and activities in common areas. 
 11.1.  Prohibited Conduct.  You, your occupants, and your  
 guests will not engage in unlawful, discourteous or  
 unreasonable behavior including, but not limited to, any of  
 the following activities: 
  (a) criminal conduct; manufacturing, delivering, or  
  possessing a controlled substance or drug parapher-  
  nalia; engaging in or threatening violence; possessing  
  a weapon prohibited by state law; discharging a firearm  
  in the apartment community; or, except when  
  allowed by law, displaying or possessing a gun, knife,  
  or other weapon in the common area, or in a way that  
  may alarm others; 
  (b) behaving in a loud, obnoxious or dangerous manner;   (c)  disturbing or threatening the rights, comfort, health, safety,  
  or convenience of others, including us, our agents, or our  
  representatives; 
  (d)  disrupting our business operations; 
  (e)  storing anything in closets containing water heaters or  
  gas appliances;
  (f)  tampering with utilities or telecommunication  
  equipment; 
  (g) bringing hazardous materials into the apartment  
  community; 
  (h) using windows for entry or exit; 
  (i)  heating the apartment with gas-operated appliances;
  (j)  making bad-faith or false allegations against us or our  
  agents to others;
  (k) smoking of any kind, that is not in accordance with our  
  Community Policies or Lease addenda; 
  (l)  using glass containers in or near pools; or
  (m) conducting any kind of business (including child-care  
  services) in your apartment or in the apartment  
  community—except for any lawful business  
  conducted “at home” by computer, mail, or telephone if  
  customers, clients, patients, employees or other  
  business associates do not come to your apartment  
  for business purposes.
12.  Animals.  No living creatures of any kind are allowed, even tempo -
rarily, anywhere in the apartment or apartment community un -
less we’ve given written permission.  If we allow an animal, you must 
sign a separate Animal Addendum and, except as set forth in the ad -
dendum, pay an animal deposit and applicable fees and additional 
monthly rent, as applicable. An animal deposit is considered a gener -
al security deposit. You represent that any requests, statements and 
representations you make, including those for an assistance or sup -
port animal, are true, accurate and made in good faith. Feeding stray, 
feral or wild animals is a breach of this Lease. 
 12.1.   Removal of Unauthorized Animal. We may remove an  
 unauthorized animal by (1) leaving, in a conspicuous  
 place in the apartment, a written notice of our intent to  
 remove the animal within 24 hours; and (2) following the  
 procedures of Par. 14. We may: keep or kennel the animal;  
 turn the animal over to a humane society, local authority  
 or rescue organization; or return the animal to you if  
 we consent to your request to keep the animal and you  
 have completed and signed an Animal Addendum and  
 paid all fees. When keeping or kenneling an animal, we  
 won’t be liable for loss, harm, sickness, or death of the  
 animal unless due to our negligence. You must pay for  
 the animal’s reasonable care and kenneling charges. 
 12.2.  Violations of Animal Policies and Charges.  If you or  
 any guest or occupant violates the animal restrictions of  
 this Lease or our Community Policies, you’ll be subject to  
 charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies  
 provided in this Lease, including animal violation charges  
 listed in Lease Details from the date the animal was  
 brought into your apartment until it is removed. If an  
 animal has been in the apartment at any time during  
 your term of occupancy (with or without our consent),  
 we’ll charge you for all cleaning and repair costs,  
 including defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing. Initial  
 and daily animal-violation charges and animal-removal  
 charges are liquidated damages for our time,  
 inconvenience, and overhead in enforcing animal  
 restrictions and Community Policies. 
13.  Parking. You may not be guaranteed parking. We may regulate the 
time, manner, and place of parking of all motorized vehicles and 
other modes of transportation, including bicycles and scooters, in 
our Community Policies. In addition to other rights we have to tow or 
boot vehicles under state law, we also have the right to remove, at the 
expense of the vehicle owner or operator, any vehicle that is not in 
compliance with our Community Policies. 
14.  When We May Enter. If you or any other resident, guest or occupant 
is present, then repair or service persons, contractors, law officers, 
government representatives, lenders, appraisers, prospective resi -
dents or buyers, insurance agents, persons authorized to enter under 
your rental application, or our representatives may peacefully enter 
the apartment at reasonable times for reasonable business purposes. 
If nobody is in the apartment, then any such person may enter peace -
fully and at reasonable times (by breaking a window or other means 
when necessary) for reasonable business purposes if written notice of 
the entry is left in a conspicuous place in the apartment immediately 
after the entry. We are under no obligation to enter only when you 
are present, and we may, but are not obligated to, give prior notice or 
make appointments.

Apartment Lease Contract ©2022, Texas Apartment Association, Inc.                                                                                                        Page 4 of 615.  Requests, Repairs and Malfunctions. 
 15.1.   Written Requests Required. If you or any occupant needs  
 to send a request—for example, for repairs, installations,  
 services, ownership disclosure, or security-related matters—  
 it must be written and delivered to our designated  
 representative in accordance with our Community Policies   
 (except for fair-housing accommodation or modification  
 requests or situations involving imminent danger or threats to  
 health or safety, such as fire, smoke, gas, explosion, or crime in  
 progress). Our written notes regarding your oral request do  
 not constitute a written request from you. Our complying  
 with or responding to any oral request doesn’t waive the strict  
 requirement for written notices under this Lease. A request  
 for maintenance or repair by anyone residing in your  
 apartment constitutes a request from all residents. The time,  
 manner, method and means of performing maintenance  
 and repairs, including whether or which vendors to use,  
 are within our sole discretion.
 15.2.  Your Requirement to Notify.  You must promptly notify us in  
 writing of air conditioning or heating problems, water leaks or  
 moisture, mold, electrical problems, malfunctioning lights,  
 broken or missing locks or latches, or any other condition that  
 poses a hazard or threat to property, health, or safety. Unless  
 we instruct otherwise, you are required to keep the  
 apartment cooled or heated according to our Community  
 Policies. Air conditioning problems are normally not  
 emergencies. 
 15.3.  Utilities.  We may change or install utility lines or  
 equipment serving the apartment if the work is done  
 reasonably without substantially increasing your  
 utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt  
 utilities as needed to perform work or to avoid  
 property damage or other emergencies. If utilities  
 malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar  
 cause, you must notify our representative immediately.  
 15.4.  Your Remedies.  We’ll act with customary diligence to  
 make repairs and reconnections within a reasonable  
 time, taking into consideration when casualty-insurance  
 proceeds are received. Unless required by statute after  
 a casualty loss, or during equipment repair, your Rent  
 will not abate in whole or in part. “Reasonable time”  
 accounts for the severity and nature of the problem and  
 the reasonable availability of materials, labor, and  
 utilities.  If we fail to timely repair a condition that  
 materially affects the physical health or safety of an  
 ordinary resident as required by the Texas Property Code,  
 you may be entitled to exercise remedies under § 92.056  
 and § 92.0561 of the Texas Property Code. If you follow  
 the procedures under those sections, the following  
 remedies, among others, may be available to you:  
 (1) termination of the Lease and an appropriate refund  
 under 92.056(f); (2) have the condition repaired or  
 remedied according to § 92.0561; (3) deduct from the Rent  
 the cost of the repair or remedy according to § 92.0561;  
 and 4) judicial remedies according to § 92.0563.
16.  Our Right to Terminate for Apartment Community Damage or 
Closure.  If, in our sole judgment, damages to the unit or building are 
significant or performance of needed repairs poses a danger to you, 
we may terminate this Lease and your right to possession by giving 
you at least 7 days’ written notice. If termination occurs, you agree 
we’ll refund only prorated rent and all deposits, minus lawful deduc -
tions. We may remove your personal property if, in our sole judg -
ment, it causes a health or safety hazard or impedes our ability to 
make repairs.
 16.1.  Property Closure.  We also have the right to terminate  
 this Lease and your right to possession by giving you at  
 least 30 days’ written notice of termination if we are  
 demolishing your apartment or closing it and it will no  
 longer be used for residential purposes for at least 6  
 months, or if any part of the property becomes subject to  
 an eminent domain proceeding.  
17.  Assignments and Subletting.  You may not assign this Lease or sub -
let your apartment. You agree that you won‘t rent, offer to rent or 
license all or any part of your apartment to anyone else unless other -
wise agreed to in advance by us in writing. You agree that you won‘t 
accept anything of value from anyone else for the use of any part of 
your apartment. You agree not to list any part of your apartment on 
any lodging or short-term rental website or with any person or ser -
vice that advertises dwellings for rent.
18.  Security and Safety Devices.  We’ll pay for missing security de -
vices that are required by law. You’ll pay for: (A) rekeying that 
you request (unless we failed to rekey after the previous resi -
dent moved out); and (B) repairs or replacements because of 
misuse or damage by you or your family, your occupants, or your 
guests. You must pay immediately after the work is done unless state 
law authorizes advance payment. You must also pay in advance for 
any additional or changed security devices you request. Texas Property Code secs. 92.151, 92.153, and 92.154 require, with 
some exceptions, that we provide at no cost to you when occupancy 
begins: (A) a window latch on each window; (B) a doorviewer (peep -
hole or window) on each exterior door; (C) a pin lock on each sliding 
door; (D) either a door-handle latch or a security bar on each sliding 
door; (E) a keyless bolting device (deadbolt) on each exterior door; 
and (F) either a keyed doorknob lock or a keyed deadbolt lock on 
one entry door. Keyed locks will be rekeyed after the prior resident 
moves out. The rekeying will be done either before you move in or 
within 7 days after you move in, as required by law. If we fail to in -
stall or rekey security devices as required by law, you have the right 
to do so and deduct the reasonable cost from your next Rent pay -
ment under Texas Property Code sec. 92.165(1). We may deactivate 
or not install keyless bolting devices on your doors if (A) you or an 
occupant in the dwelling is over 55 or disabled, and (B) the require -
ments of Texas Property Code sec. 92.153(e) or (f) are satisfied. 
 18.1.   Smoke Alarms and Detection Devices. We’ll furnish  
 smoke alarms or other detection devices required by law  
 or city ordinance. We may install additional detectors  
 not so required. We’ll test them and provide working  
 batteries when you first take possession of your  
 apartment. Upon request, we’ll provide, as required by  
 law, a smoke alarm capable of alerting a person with a  
 hearing impairment. 
  You must pay for and replace batteries as needed,  
 unless the law provides otherwise. We may replace dead  
 or missing batteries at your expense, without prior notice  
 to you. Neither you nor your guests or occupants may  
 disable alarms or detectors. If you damage or disable the  
 smoke alarm or remove a battery without replacing it  
 with a working battery, you may be liable to us under  
 Texas Property Code sec. 92.2611 for $100 plus one  
 month’s Rent, actual damages, and attorney’s fees.  
 18.2.   Duty to Report. You must immediately report to us any  
 missing, malfunctioning or defective security devices,  
 smoke alarms or detectors. You’ll be liable if you fail to  
 report malfunctions, or fail to report any loss, damage, or  
 fines resulting from fire, smoke, or water.
19.  Resident Safety and Loss.  Unless otherwise required by law, none 
of us, our employees, agents, or management companies are liable 
to you, your guests or occupants for any damage, personal injury, 
loss to personal property, or loss of business or personal income, 
from any cause, including but not limited to: negligent or intention -
al acts of residents, occupants, or guests; theft, burglary, assault, 
vandalism or other crimes; fire, flood, water leaks, rain, hail, ice, 
snow, smoke, lightning, wind, explosions, interruption of utilities, 
pipe leaks or other occurrences unless such damage, injury or loss is 
caused exclusively by our negligence. 
 We do not warrant security of any kind. You agree that you will not 
rely upon any security measures taken by us for personal security, 
and that you will call 911 and local law enforcement authorities if any 
security needs arise.
 You acknowledge that we are not equipped or trained to provide 
personal security services to you, your guests or occupants. You rec -
ognize that we are not required to provide any private security ser -
vices and that no security devices or measures on the property are 
fail-safe. You further acknowledge that, even if an alarm or gate ame -
nities are provided, they are mechanical devices that can malfunc -
tion. Any charges resulting from the use of an intrusion alarm will be 
charged to you, including, but not limited to, any false alarms with 
police/fire/ambulance response or other required city charges.
20.   Condition of the Premises and Alterations. 
 20.1.   As-Is. We disclaim all implied warranties. You accept the  
 apartment, fixtures, and furniture as is, except for  
 conditions materially affecting the health or safety of  
 ordinary persons. You’ll be given an Inventory and  
 Condition Form at or before move-in. You agree that  
 after completion of the form or within 48 hours after  
 move-in, whichever comes first, you must note on the  
 form all defects or damage, sign the form, return it to  
 us, and the form accurately reflects the condition of the  
 premises for purposes of determining any refund due to  
 you when you move out. Otherwise, everything will be  
 considered to be in a clean, safe, and good working  
 condition. You must still send a separate request for any  
 repairs needed as provided by Par. 15.1.
 20.2.   Standards and Improvements. Unless authorized by  
 law or by us in writing, you must not perform any repairs,  
 painting, wallpapering, carpeting, electrical changes, or  
 otherwise alter our property. No holes or stickers are  
 allowed inside or outside the apartment. Unless our  
 Community Policies state otherwise, we’ll permit a  
 reasonable number of small nail holes for hanging  
 pictures on sheetrock walls and in grooves of wood-  
 paneled walls. No water furniture, washing machines,  
 dryers, extra phone or television outlets, alarm systems,

Apartment Lease Contract ©2022, Texas Apartment Association, Inc.                                                                                               Page 5 of 6 cameras, video or other doorbells, or lock changes,  
 additions, or rekeying is permitted unless required by law  
 or we’ve consented in writing. You may install a satellite  
 dish or antenna, but only if you sign our satellite-dish or  
 antenna lease addendum, which complies with reasonable  
 restrictions allowed by federal law. You must not alter,  
 damage, or remove our property, including alarm systems,  
 detection devices, appliances, furniture, telephone and  
 television wiring, screens, locks, or security devices. When you  
 move in, we’ll supply light bulbs for fixtures we furnish,  
 including exterior fixtures operated from inside the  
 apartment; after that, you’ll replace them at your expense  
 with bulbs of the same type and wattage. Your improvements  
 to the apartment (made with or without our consent) become  
 ours unless we agree otherwise in writing.
21. Notices.  Written notice to or from our employees, agents, or  
management companies constitutes notice to or from us. Notices to 
you or any other resident of the apartment constitute notice to all 
residents. Notices and requests from any resident constitute notice 
from all residents. Only residents can give notice of Lease termination 
and intent to move out under Par. 7.3. All notices and documents will 
be in English and, at our option, in any other language that you read 
or speak.
 21.1.  Electronic Notice.  Notice may be given electronically by  
 us to you  if allowed by law. If allowed by law and in  
 accordance with our Community Policies, electronic  
 notice from you to us  must be sent to the email address  
 and/or portal specified in Community Policies. Notice  
 may also be given by phone call or to a physical address  
 if allowed in our Community Policies. 
  You represent that you have provided your current email  
 address to us, and that you will notify us in the event your  
 email address changes.
EVICTION AND REMEDIES
22. Liability.  Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all Lease  
obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates the Lease or our 
Community Policies, all residents are considered to have violated the 
Lease. 
 22.1.  Indemnification by You.  You’ll defend, indemnify and hold us  
 and our employees, agents, and management company  
 harmless from all liability arising from your conduct or  
 requests to our representatives and from the conduct of or  
 requests by your invitees, occupants or guests. 
23. Default by Resident. 
 23.1. Acts of Default.  You’ll be in default if: (A) you don’t  
 timely pay Rent, including monthly recurring charges, or  
 other amounts you owe; (B) you or any guest or  
 occupant violates this Lease, our Community Policies,  
 or fire, safety, health, criminal or other laws, regardless of  
 whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (C) you  
 give incorrect, incomplete, or false answers in a rental  
 application or in this Lease; or (D) you or any occupant is  
 charged, detained, convicted, or given deferred  
 adjudication or pretrial diversion for (1) an offense  
 involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or  
 involving the manufacture or delivery of a controlled  
 substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia as defined  
 in the Texas Controlled Substances Act, or (2) any sex-  
 related crime, including a misdemeanor.
 23.2. Eviction. If you default, including holding over, we may  
 end your right of occupancy by giving you at least a 24-  
 hour written notice to vacate.  Termination of your possession  
 rights doesn’t release you from liability for future Rent or  
 other Lease obligations. After giving notice to vacate or  
 filing an eviction suit, we may still accept Rent or other  
 sums due; the filing or acceptance doesn’t waive or  
 diminish our right of eviction or any other contractual or  
 statutory right.  Accepting money at any time doesn’t waive  
 our right to damages, to past or future Rent or other sums,  
 or to our continuing with eviction proceedings. In an eviction,  
 Rent is owed for the full rental period and will not be  
 prorated. 
 23.3.  Acceleration.  Unless we elect not to accelerate Rent, all  
 monthly Rent for the rest of the Lease term or renewal  
 period will be accelerated automatically without notice  
 or demand (before or after acceleration) and will be  
 immediately due if, without our written consent: (A) you  
 move out, remove property in preparing to move out,  
 or you or any occupant gives oral or written notice of  
 intent to move out before the Lease term or renewal  
 period ends; and (B) you haven’t paid all Rent for the  
 entire Lease term or renewal period. Remaining Rent will  
 also be accelerated if you’re judicially evicted or move  
 out when we demand because you’ve defaulted.
   If you don’t pay the first month’s Rent when or before the  
 Lease begins, all future Rent for the Lease term will be  
 automatically accelerated without notice and become  
 immediately due. We also may end your right of occupancy  
 and recover damages, future Rent, attorney’s fees, court costs,  
 and other lawful charges.  
 23.4. Holdover. You or any occupant or guest must not hold  
 over beyond the date contained in: (1) your move-out  
 notice, (2) our notice to vacate, (3) our notice of non-  
 renewal, or (4) a written agreement specifying a different  
 move-out date. If a holdover occurs, then you’ll be  
 liable to us for all Rent for the full term of the previously  
 signed lease of a new resident who can’t occupy because  
 of the holdover, and at our option, we may extend the  
 Lease term and/or increase the Rent by 25% by delivering  
 written notice to you or your apartment while you continue  
 to hold over.
 23.5. Other Remedies.  We may report unpaid amounts to  
 credit agencies as allowed by law. If we or our debt  
 collector tries to collect any money you owe us, you  
 agree that we or the debt collector may contact you by  
 any legal means. If you default, you will pay us, in addition  
 to other sums due, any rental discounts or concessions  
 agreed to in writing that have been applied to your account.  
 We may recover attorney’s fees in connection with enforcing  
 our rights under this Lease. All unpaid amounts you owe bear  
 interest at the rate provided by Texas Finance Code Section  
 304.003(c) from the due date. You must pay all collection-  
 agency fees if you fail to pay sums due within 10 days after  
 you are mailed a letter demanding payment and stating that  
 collection-agency fees will be added if you don’t pay all sums  
 by that deadline. You are also liable for a charge (not to  
 exceed $150) to cover our time, cost and expense for any  
 eviction proceeding against you, plus our attorney’s fees and  
 expenses, court costs, and filing fees actually paid.
24.  Representatives’ Authority and Waivers.  Our representatives (in -
cluding management personnel, employees, and agents) have no 
authority to waive, amend, or terminate this Lease or any part of it 
unless in writing and signed, and no authority to make promises, rep -
resentations, or agreements that impose security duties or other ob -
ligations on us or our representatives, unless in writing and signed. 
No action or omission by us will be considered a waiver of our rights or of 
any subsequent violation, default, or time or place of performance. Our 
choice to enforce, not enforce or delay enforcement of written-no -
tice requirements, rental due dates, acceleration, liens, or any other 
rights isn’t a waiver under any circumstances. Delay in demanding 
sums you owe is not a waiver. Except when notice or demand is required 
by law, you waive any notice and demand for performance from us if you 
default. Nothing in this Lease constitutes a waiver of our remedies for a 
breach under your prior lease that occurred before the Lease term begins.
 All remedies are cumulative. Exercising one remedy won’t constitute 
an election or waiver of other remedies. All provisions regarding our 
nonliability or nonduty apply to our employees, agents, and manage -
ment companies. No employee, agent, or management company is 
personally liable for any of our contractual, statutory, or other obliga -
tions merely by virtue of acting on our behalf.  
END OF THE LEASE TERM
25. Move-Out Notice.  Before moving out, you must give our represen -
tative advance written move-out notice as stated in Par. 4, even if 
the Lease has become a month-to-month lease.  The move-out date 
can’t be changed unless we and you both agree in writing.
 Your move-out notice must comply with each of the following:
 (a) Unless we require more than 30 days’ notice, if you give  
 notice on the first day of the month you intend to move  
 out, move out will be on the last day of that month.
 (b) Your move-out notice must not terminate the Lease  
 before the end of the Lease term or renewal period.
 (c) If we require you to give us more than 30 days’ written  
 notice to move out before the end of the Lease term, we  
 will give you 1 written reminder not less than 5 days nor  
 more than 90 days before your deadline for giving us  
 your written move-out notice. If we fail to give a reminder  
 notice, 30 days’ written notice to move out is required.
 (d) You must get from us a written acknowledgment of your  
 notice.
26. Move-Out Procedures. 
 26. 1.  Cleaning.  You must thoroughly clean the apartment, including  
 doors, windows, furniture, bathrooms, kitchen appliances,  
 patios, balconies, garages, carports, and storage rooms. You  
 must follow move-out cleaning instructions if they have been  
 provided. If you don’t clean adequately, you’ll be liable for  
 reasonable cleaning charges—including charges for cleaning  
 carpets, draperies, furniture, walls, etc. that are soiled beyond  
 normal wear (that is, wear or soiling that occurs without  
 negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse).

 26.2.  Move-Out Inspection.  We may, but are not obligated to,  
 provide a joint move-out inspection.  Our representatives  
 have no authority to bind or limit us regarding deductions for  
 repairs, damages, or charges. Any statements or estimates by  
 us or our representative are subject to our correction, modi-  
 fication, or disapproval before final accounting or refunding.
27. Surrender and Abandonment.  You have surrendered  the apartment 
when: (A) the move-out date has passed and no one is living in the 
apartment in our reasonable judgment; or (B) apartment keys and ac -
cess devices listed in Par. 2.1 have been turned in to us—whichever 
happens first. 
 You have abandoned  the apartment when all of the following have 
occurred: (A) everyone appears to have moved out in our reasonable 
judgment; (B) you’ve been in default for nonpayment of Rent for 5 
consecutive days, or water, gas, or electric service for the apartment 
not connected in our name has been terminated or transferred; and  
(C) you’ve not responded for 2 days to our notice left on the inside of 
the main entry door stating that we consider the apartment aban -
doned. An apartment is also considered abandoned 10 days after the 
death of a sole resident.
 27.1.  The Ending of Your Rights.  Surrender, abandonment, or  
 judicial eviction ends your right of possession for all purposes  
 and gives us the immediate right to clean up, make repairs in,  
 and relet the apartment; determine any security-deposit  
 deductions; and remove or store property left in the apartment. 
 27.2.   Removal and Storage of Property.  We, or law officers, may—  
 but have no duty to—remove or store all property that in our  
 sole judgment belongs to you and remains in the apartment  
 or in common areas (including any vehicles you or any  
 occupant or guest owns or uses) after you’re judicially evicted  
 or if you surrender or abandon the apartment.
  We’re not liable for casualty, loss, damage, or theft. You  
 must pay reasonable charges for our packing, removing and  
 storing any property. 
  Except for animals, we may throw away or give to a charitable  
 organization all personal property that is: 
  (1)  left in the apartment after surrender or abandonment; or 
  (2)  left outside more than 1 hour after writ of possession is  
        executed, following judicial eviction.
  An animal removed after surrender, abandonment, or eviction  
 may be kenneled or turned over to a local authority, humane  
 society, or rescue organization.
GENERAL PROVISIONS AND SIGNATURES
28. TAA Membership. We, the management company representing us, 
or any locator service that you used confirms membership in good 
standing of both the Texas Apartment Association and the affiliated 
local apartment association for the area where the apartment is  
located at the time of signing this Lease. If not, the following applies: 
(A) this Lease is voidable at your option and is unenforceable by us 
(except for property damages); and (B) we may not recover past or 
future rent or other charges. The above remedies also apply if both 
of the following occur: (1) the Lease is automatically renewed on a 
month-to-month basis more than once after membership in TAA and 
the local association has lapsed; and (2) neither the owner nor the man -
agement company is a member of TAA and the local association during 
the third automatic renewal. A signed affidavit from the affiliated local 
apartment association attesting to nonmembership when the Lease 
or renewal was signed will be conclusive evidence of nonmembership. 
Governmental entities may use TAA forms if TAA agrees in writing.

29. Severability and Survivability.  If any provision of this Lease is invalid 
or unenforceable under applicable law, it won’t invalidate the remain -
der of the Lease or change the intent of the parties. Paragraphs 10.1, 
10.2, 16, 27 and 31 shall survive the termination of this Lease. 
This Lease binds subsequent owners.
30. Controlling Law.  Texas law governs this Lease. All litigation arising 
under this Lease and all Lease obligations must be brought in the 
county, and precinct if applicable, where the apartment is located.
31.  Waivers.   By signing this Lease, you agree to the following: 
 31.1.  Class Action Waiver.  You agree that you will not participate  
 in any class action claims against us or our employees, agents,  
 or management company. You must file any claim against us  
 individually, and you expressly waive your right to bring,  
 represent, join or otherwise maintain a class action,  
 collective action or similar proceeding against us in  
 any forum.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, WITHOUT THIS WAIVER, YOU  
 COULD BE A PARTY IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. BY  
 SIGNING THIS LEASE, YOU ACCEPT THIS WAIVER AND  
 CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY.  
 THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL SURVIVE  
 THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THIS LEASE.
 31.2.   Force Majeure.  If we are prevented from completing substan-  
 tial performance of any obligation under this Lease by  
 occurrences that are beyond our control, including but  
 not limited to, an act of God, strikes, epidemics, war, acts of  
 terrorism, riots, flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, sabotage or  
 governmental regulation, then we shall be excused from any  
 further performance of obligations to the fullest extent  
 allowed by law. 
 32. Special Provisions.  The following, or attached Special Provisions and 
any addenda or Community Policies provided to you, are part of this 
Lease and supersede any conflicting provisions in this Lease.

Texas Apartment AssociationWATER AND WASTEWATER SUBMETERING ADDENDUM
1. Addendum.  This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No.   in the  
   
   
                                         Apartments in  ,  
Texas OR
the house, duplex, etc. located at (street address)     
                                       in  , Texas.
2. PUC.  Water conservation by submeter billing is encouraged by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC). Submeter billing is regulated 
by PUC rules, and a copy of the rules is attached to this addendum. This addendum complies with those rules.
3. Mutual Conservation Efforts.  We agree to use our best efforts to repair any water leaks inside or outside your apartment no later than 
7 days after we learn about them. You agree to use your best efforts to follow the water-conservation suggestions listed in the checklist 
below.
4. Submeter Billing Procedures.  Your monthly rent under the TAA Lease does not include a charge for water and wastewater. Instead, 
you will receive a separate monthly bill from us for submetered water and wastewater use, as follows:
(A)  Your monthly water and wastewater bill will conform to all applicable rules of the PUC (see attached).
(B)  As permitted by state law, a service fee of         % (not to exceed 9%) will be added to your monthly water-service charges.
(C)  No other administrative or other fees will be added to your bill unless expressly allowed by law or PUC rules. No other amounts will be 
included in the bill except your unpaid balances and any late fees (if incurred by you). If we fail to pay our mastermeter bill to the utility 
company on time and incur penalties or interest, no portion of these amounts will be included in your bill.
(D)  We will calculate your submetered share of the mastermetered water bill according to PUC rules, Section 24.281.
(E)  We will bill you monthly for your submetered water consumption from approximately the        day of the month to the    
day of the month, the latter being our scheduled submeter-reading date. Your bill will be calculated in accordance with PUC rules and 
this Addendum and will be prorated for the first and last months you live in the unit.
(F)  PUC rules require us to publish figures from the previous calendar year if that information is available. The average monthly bill for all 
dwelling units in the apartment community last year was $             per unit, varying from $             for the lowest  
month’s bill to $            for the highest month’s bill for any unit. This information may or may not be relevant since the past 
amounts may not reflect future changes in utility-company water rates, weather variations, future total water consumption, changes in 
water-consumption habits of residents, and other unpredictable factors.
(G)  During regular weekday office hours, you may examine: (1) our water and wastewater bills from the utility company; (2) our calculation 
of your monthly submeter bill; and (3) any other information available to you under PUC rules. Please give us reasonable advance 
notice to gather the data. Any disputes relating to the computation of your bill will be between you and us.
5. Your Payment-Due Date.  Payment of your submeter water and wastewater bill is due 16 days after the date it is postmarked or hand 
delivered to your apartment. You agree to mail or deliver payment to the place indicated on your bill so that payment is received no later 
than the due date. You will pay a late charge of 5% of your water and wastewater bill if we do not receive your payment on time.
A Checklist of Water-Conservation Ideas for Your Dwelling
In the bathroom . . .
•  Never put cleansing tissues, dental floss, cigarette butts, or other trash in the toilet.
•  When brushing your teeth, turn off the water until you need to rinse your mouth.
•  When shaving, fill the sink with hot water instead of letting the faucet run.
•  Take a shower instead of filling the tub and taking a bath.
•  Take a shorter shower. Showers may use up to half of your interior water consumption.
•  If you take a tub bath, reduce the water level by one or two inches.
•  Shampoo your hair in the shower.
•  Test toilets for leaks. Add a few drops of food coloring to the tank, but do not flush. Watch to see if the coloring appears in the bowl within 
a few minutes. If it does, the fixture needs adjustment or repair. A slow drip can waste as much as 170 gallons a day or 5,000 gallons per 
month. Report all leaks to management.
•  Don’t leave water running while cleaning bathroom fixtures.
In the kitchen . . .
•  Run your dishwasher only when you have a full load.
•  If you wash dishes by hand, don’t leave the water running for washing or rinsing. Fill the sink instead.
•  Use your sink disposal sparingly, and never for just a few scraps.
•  Keep a container of drinking water in the refrigerator.
•  When cleaning vegetables, use a pan of cold water rather than letting the faucet run.
•  For cooking most food, use only a little water and place a lid on the pot.
•  Report all leaks to management.
When doing the laundry . . .
•  Wash only full loads of laundry or else adjust the water level to match the size of the load (if you have this option).
•  Use cold water as often as possible to save energy and to conserve the hot water for uses that cold water cannot serve.

(4) Copies of the records may be provided by mail if postmarked by midnight of the last day specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection.  
§ 24.279. Rental Agreement  
(a) Rental agreement content. The rental agreement between the owner and tenant shall clearly state in writing:

(b) Requirement to provide rules. At the time a rental agreement is discussed, the owner shall provide a copy of this subchapter or a copy of the rules to the tenant to inform the tenant of his rights and the owner's responsibilities under this subchapter.  
(c) Tenant agreement to billing method changes. An owner shall not change the method by which a tenant is billed unless the tenant has agreed to the change by signing a lease or other written agreement. The owner shall provide notice of the proposed change at least 35 days pri or to implementing 
the new method.  
(d) Change from submetered to allocated billing. An owner shall not change from submetered billing to allocated billing, except after receiving written approval from the commission after a demonstration of good cause and if the rental agreement requirements under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section have been met. Good cause may include:  
(1) equipment failures; or  
(2) meter reading or billing problems that could not feasibly be corrected.  (e) Waiver of tenant rights prohibited. A rental agreement provision that purports to waive a tenant's rights or an owner's responsibilities under this subchapter is void.  
§ 24.281. Charges and Calculations  
(a) Prohibited charges. Charges billed to tenants for submetered or alloca ted 
utility service may only include bills for water or wastewater from the retail public utility and must not include any fees billed to the owner by the retail public utility for any deposit, disconnect, reconnect, late payment, or other similar fees.  
(b) Dwelling unit base charge. If the retail public utility's rate structure includes 
a dwelling unit base charge, the owner shall bill each dwelling unit for the base charge applicable to that unit. The owner may not bill tenants for any dwelling unit base charges applicable to unoccupied dwelling units.  
(c) Customer service charge. If the retail public utility's rate structure includes a customer service charge, the owner shall bill each dwelling unit the amount of the customer service charge divided by the total number of dwelling units, 
including vacant units, that can receive service through the master meter serving the tenants.  
(d) Calculations for submetered utility service. The tenant's submetered charges must include the dwelling unit base charge and customer service charge, if applicable, and the gallonage charge and must be calculated each month as follows:  
(1) water utility service: the retail public utility's total monthly charges for water service (less dwelling unit base charges or customer servi ce 
charges, if applicable), divided by the total monthly water consumption measured by the retail public utility to obtain an average water cost per gallon, liter, or cubic foot, multiplied by the tenant's monthly consumption or the volumetric rate charged by the retail public utility to the owner 
multiplied by the tenant's monthly water consumption;  
(2) wastewater utility service: the retail public utility's total monthly charges for wastewater service (less dwelling unit base charges or customer service charges, if applicable), divided by the total monthly water consumption measured by the retail public utility, multiplied by the tenant's monthly consumption or the volumetric wastewater rate charged by the retail public utility to the owner multiplied by t he tenant's monthly water 
consumption;  
(3) service charge for manufactured home rental community or the owner or manager of apartment house: a manufactured home rental community or apartment house may charge a service charge in an amount not to exceed 9% of the tenant's charge for submetered water and wastewater service, except when;  
(A) the resident resides in a unit of an apartment house that has received an allocation of low income housing tax credits under Texas Government Code, Chapter 2306, Subchapter  DD; or  
(B) the apartment resident receives tenant -based voucher assistance 
under United States Housing Act of 1937 Section 8, (42 United States Code, §1437f); and  
(4) final bill on move- out for submetered service: if a tenant moves out 
during a billing period, the owner may calculate a final bill for the tenant before the owner receives the bill for that period from the retail public utility. If the owner is billing using the average water or wastewater cost per gallon, liter, or cubic foot as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the owner may calculate the tenant's bill by calculating the tenant's average volumetric rate for the last three months and multiplying that average volumetric rate by the tenant's consumption for the billing period.  
(e) Calculations for allocated utility service.  
(1) Before an owner may allocate the retail public utility's master meter bill for water and sewer service to the tenants, the owner shall first deduct:  
(A) dwel ling unit base charges or customer service charge, if applicable; 
and 
(B) common area usage such as installed landscape irrigation systems, pools, and laundry rooms, if any, as follows:  
(i) if all common areas are separately metered or submetered, deduct the actual common area usage;  
(ii) if common areas that are served through the master meter that provides water to the dwelling units are not separately metered or submetered and there is an installed landscape irrigation system, deduct at least 25% of the retail public utility's master meter bill;  
(iii) if all water used for an installed landscape irrigation system is metered or submetered and there are other common areas such as pools or laundry rooms that are not metered or submetered, deduct at least 5% of the retail public utility's master meter bill; or  
(iv) if common areas that are served through the master meter that provides water to the dwelling units are not separately metered or

submetered and there is no installed landscape irrigation system, 
deduct at least 5% of the retail public utility's master meter bill.  
(2) To calculate a tenant's bill:  
(A) for an apartment house, the owner shall multiply the amount established in paragraph (1) of this subsection by:  
(i) the number of occupants in the tenan t's dwelling unit divided by the 
total number of occupants in all dwelling units at the beginning of the month for which bills are being rendered; or  
(ii) the number of occupants in the tenant's dwelling unit using a ratio occupancy formula divided by the total number of occupants in all dwelling units at the beginning of the retail public utility's billing period using the same ratio occupancy formula to determine the total. The ratio occupancy formula will reflect what the owner believes more accurately r epresents the water use in units that are occupied by 
multiple tenants. The ratio occupancy formula that is used must assign a fractional portion per tenant of no less than that on the following scale:  
(I) dwelling unit with one occupant = 1;  
(II) dwelling  unit with two occupants = 1.6;  
(III) dwelling unit with three occupants = 2.2; or  
(IV) dwelling unit with more than three occupants = 2.2 + 0.4 per each additional occupant over three; or  
(iii) the average number of occupants per bedroom, which shall be determined by the following occupancy formula. The formula must 
calculate the average number of occupants in all dwelling units based on the number of bedrooms in the dwelling unit according to the scale below, notwithstanding the actual number of occupants  in each of the 
dwelling unit's bedrooms or all dwelling units:  
(I) dwelling unit with an efficiency = 1;  
(II) dwelling unit with one bedroom = 1.6;  
(III) dwelling unit with two bedrooms = 2.8;  
(IV) dwelling unit with three bedrooms = 4 + 1.2 for each additional bedroom; or  
(iv) a factor using a combination of square footage and occupancy in which no more than 50% is based on square footage. The square footage portion must be based on the total square footage living area of the dwelling unit as a percentage of the total square footage living area of all dwelling units of the apartment house; or  
(v) the individually submetered hot or cold water usage of the tenant's dwelling unit divided by all submetered hot or cold water usage in all dwelling units;  
(B) a condominium manager shall multiply the amount established in 
paragraph (1) of this subsection by any of the factors under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or may follow the methods outlined in the condominium contract;  
(C) for a manufactured home rent al community, the owner shall multiply 
the amount established in paragraph (1) of this subsection by:  
(i) any of the factors developed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; or  
(ii) the area of the individual rental space divided by the total area of all rental spaces; and  
(D) for a multiple use facility, the owner shall multiply the amount established in paragraph (1) of this subsection by:  
(i) any of the factors developed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; or  
(ii) the square footage of the rental space divided by the total square footage of all rental spaces.  
(3) If a tenant moves in or out during a billing period, the owner may calculate a bill for the tenant. If the tenant moves in during a billing period, the owner shall prorate the bill by calculating a bill as if the tenant were there for the whole month and then charging the tenant for only the number of days the tenant lived in the unit divided by the number of days in the month multiplied by the calculated bill. If a tenant moves out during a billing period before the owner receives the bill for that period from the retail public utility, the owner may calculate a final bill. The owner may calculate the tenant's bill by calculating the tenant's average bill for the last three months and mul tiplying that average bill by the number of days the tenant was in 
the unit divided by the number of days in that month.  
(f) Conversion to approved allocation method. An owner using an allocation formula other than those approved in subsection (e) of this section shall immediately provide notice as required under §24.279(c) of this title (relating to Rental Agreement) and either:  
(1) adopt one of the methods in subsection (e) of this section; or  (2) install submeters and begin billing on a submetered basis;  or 
(3) discontinue billing for utility services.  
§ 24.283. Billing  
(a) Monthly billing of total charges. The owner shall bill the tenant each month for the total charges calculated under §24.281 of this title (relating to Charges and Calculations). If it is permitted in the rental agreement, an occupant or 
occupants who are not residing in the rental unit for a period longer than 30 days may be excluded from the occupancy calculation and from paying a water and sewer bill for that peri od. 
(b) Rendering bill.  
(1) Allocated bills shall be rendered as promptly as possible after the owner receives the retail public utility bill.  
(2) Submeter bills shall be rendered as promptly as possible after the owner receives the retail public utility bill or according to the time schedule in the rental agreement if the owner is billing using the retail public utility's rate. 
(c) Submeter reading schedule. Submeters or point -of-use submeters shall 
be read within three days of the scheduled reading date of the retail public utility's master meter or according to the schedule in the rental agreement if the owner is billing using the retail public utility's rate.  
(d) Billing period.  
(1) Allocated bills shall be rendered for the same billing period as that of  
the retail public utility, generally monthly, unless service is provided for less than that period.  
(2) Submeter bills shall be rendered for the same billing period as that of the retail public utility, generally monthly, unless service is provided for less than that period. If the owner uses the retail public utility's actual rate, the billing period may be an alternate billing period specified in the rental agreement.  
(e) Multi -item bill. If issued on a multi -item bill, charges for submetered or 
allocated utility service must be separate and distinct from any other charges on the bill.  
(f) Information on bill. The bill must clearly state that the utility service is submetered or allocated, as applicable, and must include all of the following:  
(1) total am ount due for submetered or allocated water;  
(2) total amount due for submetered or allocated wastewater;  
(3) total amount due for dwelling unit base charge(s) or customer service charge(s) or both, if applicable;  
(4) total amount due for water or wastewate r usage, if applicable;  
(5) the name of the retail public utility and a statement that the bill is not from the retail public utility;  
(6) name and address of the tenant to whom the bill is applicable;  
(7) name of the firm rendering the bill and the name or title, address, and telephone number of the firm or person to be contacted in case of a billing dispute; and  
(8) name, address, and telephone number of the party to whom payment is to be made.  
(g) Information on submetered service. In addition to the inf ormation required 
in subsection (f) of this section, a bill for submetered service must include all of the following:  
(1) the total number of gallons, liters, or cubic feet submetered or measured by point -of-use submeters;  
(2) the cost per gallon, liter, or cubic foot for each service provided; and  
(3) total amount due for a service charge charged by an owner of a manufactured home rental community, if applicable.  
(h) Due date. The due date on the bill may not be less than 16 days after it is mailed or hand delivered to the tenant, unless the due date falls on a federal 
holiday or weekend, in which case the following work day will be the due date. The owner shall record the date the bill is mailed or hand delivered. A payment is delinquent if not received by  the due date.  
(i) Estimated bill. An estimated bill may be rendered if a master meter, submeter, or point -of-use submeter has been tampered with, cannot be read, 
or is out of order; and in such case, the bill must be distinctly marked as an estimate and the subsequent bill must reflect an adjustment for actual charges.  
(j) Payment by tenant. Unless utility bills are paid to a third- party billing 
company on behalf of the owner, or unless clearly designated by the tenant, payment must be applied first to rent and then to utilities.  
(k) Overbilling and underbilling. If a bill is issued and subsequently found to be in error, the owner shall calculate a billing adjustment. If the tenant is due a refund, an adjustment must be calculated for all of t hat tenant's bills that

included overcharges. If the overbilling or underbilling affects all tenants, an 
adjustment must be calculated for all of the tenants' bills. If the tenant was undercharged, and the cause was not due to submeter or point -of-use 
subm eter error, the owner may calculate an adjustment for bills issued in the 
previous six months. If the total undercharge is $25 or more, the owner shall offer the tenant a deferred payment plan option, for the same length of time as that of the underbilling. Adjustments for usage by a previous tenant may not be back billed to a current tenant.  
(l) Disputed bills. In the event of a dispute between a tenant and an owner regarding any bill, the owner shall investigate the matter and report the results of the investigation to the tenant in writing. The investigation and report must be completed within 30 days from the date the tenant gives written notification of the dispute to the owner.  
(m) Late fee. A one- time penalty not to exceed 5% may be applied to 
delinquent accounts. If such a penalty is applied, the bill must indicate the amount due if the late penalty is incurred. No late penalty may be applied unless agreed to by the tenant in a written lease that states the percentage amount of such late penalty.  
§ 24.285. Complaint Jurisdiction  
(a) Jurisdiction. The commission has exclusive jurisdiction for violations under this subchapter.  
(b) Complaints. If an apartment house owner, condominium manager, manufactured home rental community owner, or other multiple use facility 
owner violates a commission rule regarding utility costs, the person claiming the violation may file a complaint with the commission and may appear remotely for a hearing.  
§ 24.287. Submeters or Point -of-Use Submeters and Plumbing Fixtures  
(a) Su bmeters or point -of-use submeters.  
(1) Same type submeters or point -of-use submeters required. All

same unit of measurement, such as gallon, liter, or cubic foot.  
(2) Installation by ow ner. The owner shall be responsible for providing, 
installing, and maintaining all submeters or point -of-use submeters 
necessary for the measurement of water to tenants and to common areas, if applicable.  
(3) Submeter or point -of-use submeter tests prior t o installation. No 
submeter or point -of-use submeter may be placed in service unless its 
accuracy has been established. If any submeter or point -of-use submeter 
is removed from service, it must be properly tested and calibrated before being placed in servi ce again.  
(4) Accuracy requirements for submeters and point -of-use submeters. 
Submeters must be calibrated as close as possible to the condition of zero error and within the accuracy standards established by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) for water meters. Point -of-use submeters 
must be calibrated as closely as possible to the condition of zero error and within the accuracy standards established by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) for point -of-use and branch- water 
submetering systems.  
(5) Location of submeters and point -of-use submeters. Submeters and 
point -of-use submeters must be installed in accordance with applicable 
plumbing codes and AWWA standards for water meters or ASME standards for point -of-use submeters, and must be readily accessible to 
the tenant and to the owner for testing and inspection where such activities will cause minimum interference and inconvenience to the tenant.  
(6) Submeter and point -of-use submeter records. The owner shall maintain 
a record on each submeter or point -of-use submeter which includes:  
(A) an identifying number;  
(B) the installation date (and removal date, if applicable);  
(C) date(s) the submeter or point -of-use submeter was calibrated or 
tested;  
(D) copies of all tests; and  
(E) the current location of the submeter or point -of-use submeter.  
(7) Submeter or point -of-use submeter test on request of tenant. Upon 
receiving a written request from the tenant, the owner shall either:  
(A) provide evidence, at no charge to the tenant, that the submeter or

months and determined to be within the accuracy standards established by the AWWA for water meters or ASME standards for point -of-use 
submeters; or  
(B) have the submeter or  point -of-use submeter removed and tested and 
promptly advise the tenant of the test results.  
(8) Billing for submeter or point -of-use submeter test.  (A) The owner may not bill the tenant for testing costs if the submeter fails to meet AWWA accuracy standards for water meters or ASME standards for point -of-use submeters.  
(B) The owner may not bill the tenant for testing costs if there is no evidence that the submeter or point -of-use submeter was calibrated or 
tested within the preceding 24 months.  
(C) The o wner may bill the tenant for actual testing costs (not to exceed 
$25) if the submeter meets AWWA accuracy standards or the point -of-
use submeter meets ASME accuracy standards and evidence as described in paragraph (7)(A) of this subsection was provided to the tenant.  
(9) Bill adjustment due to submeter or point -of-use submeter error. If a 
submeter does not meet AWWA accuracy standards or a point -of-use 
submeter does not meet ASME accuracy standards and the tenant was overbilled, an adjusted bill must be rendered in accordance with §24.283(k) of this title (relating to Billing). The owner may not charge the tenant for any underbilling that occurred because the submeter or point -of-use 
submeter was in error.  
(10) Submeter or point -of-use submeter testing facil ities and equipment. 
For submeters, an owner shall comply with the AWWA's meter testing requirements. For point -of-use meters, an owner shall comply with ASME's 
meter testing requirements.  
(b) Plumbing fixtures. After January 1, 2003, before an owner of an apartment 
house, manufactured home rental community, or multiple use facility or a manager of a condominium may implement a program to bill tenants for submetered or allocated water service, the owner or manager shall adhere to the following standards:  
(1) Texas Health and Safety Code, §372.002, for sink or lavatory faucets, 
faucet aerators, and showerheads;  
(2) perform a water leak audit of each dwelling unit or rental unit and each common area and repair any leaks found; and

Mold Information and Prevention Addendum
1. Addendum.  This is an addendum to the Lease Contract executed by 
you, the resident or residents, on the dwelling you have agreed to rent. 
That dwelling is: Unit #   at  
  
  
  
 , 
           (name of apartments)
or other dwelling located at   
  
  
       (street address of house, duplex, etc.)
City/State where dwelling is located   
 .
2. About Mold. Mold is found everywhere in our environment, both 
indoors and outdoors and in both new and old structures. Molds are 
nothing new—they are natural microscopic organisms that reproduce 
by spores. They have always been with us. In the environment, molds 
break down organic matter and use the end product for food. Without 
molds we would be struggling with large amounts of dead organic 
matter. Mold spores (like plant pollen) spread through the air and are 
commonly transported by shoes, clothing, and other materials. There is 
conflicting scientific evidence about how much mold must accumulate 
before it creates adverse health effects on people and animals. Even so, 
we must take appropriate precautions to prevent its buildup.
3. Preventing Mold Begins with Y ou. to minimze the potential for mold 
growth in your dwelling, you must:
•  Keep your dwelling clean—particularly the kitchen, bathroom, 
carpets, and floors. Regular vacuuming and mopping of the floors, 
plus cleaning hard surfaces using a household cleaner, are all 
important to remove the household dirt and debris that harbor 
mold or food for mold. Throw away moldy food immediately.
•  Remove visible moisture accumulations on windows, walls, ceilings, 
floors, and other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible. Look for 
leaks in washing-machine hoses and discharge lines—especially if 
the leak is large enough for water to seep into nearby walls. If your 
dwelling has them, turn on exhaust fans in the bathroom before 
showering and in the kitchen before cooking with open pots. 
Also when showering, keep the shower curtain inside the tub (or 
fully close the shower doors). Experts also recommend that after 
a shower or bath you (1) wipe moisture off shower walls, shower 
doors, the bathtub, and the bathroom floor; (2) leave the bathroom 
door open until all moisture on the mirrors and bathroom walls and 
tile surfaces has dissipated; and (3) hang up your towels and bath 
mats so they will completely dry out.
•  Promptly notify us in writing about any air-conditioning or heating-
system problems you discover. Follow any of our rules about 
replacing air filters. It’s also good practice to open windows and 
doors periodically on days when the outdoor weather is dry (i.e., 
humidity is below 50%) to help humid areas of your dwelling dry 
out.
•  Promptly notify us in writing of any signs of water leaks, water 
infiltration, or mold. We will respond in accordance with state 
law and the Lease Contract to repair or remedy the situation as 
necessary.4. Avoiding Moisture Buildup.  To avoid mold growth, it’s important to 
prevent excess moisture buildup in your dwelling. Failing to promptly 
attend to leaks and moisture accumulations on dwelling surfaces can 
encourage mold growth, especially in places where they might get 
inside walls or ceilings. Prolonged moisture can come from a wide 
variety of sources, such as:
•  rainwater leaking from roofs, windows, doors, and outside walls, as 
well as flood waters rising above floor level;
•  overflows from showers, bathtubs, toilets, sinks, washing machines, 
dehumidifiers, refrigerator or air-conditioner drip pans, or clogged 
air-conditioner condensation lines;
•  leaks from plumbing lines or fixtures, and leaks into walls from bad 
or missing grouting or caulking around showers, bathtubs, or sinks;
•  washing-machine hose leaks, plant-watering overflows, pet urine, 
cooking spills, beverage spills, and steam from excessive open-pot 
cooking;
•  leaks from clothes-dryer discharge vents (which can put a lot of 
moisture into the air); and
•  insufficient drying of carpets, carpet pads, shower walls, and 
bathroom floors.
5. Cleaning Mold.  If small areas of mold have already accumulated on 
nonporous surfaces (such as ceramic tile, formica, vinyl flooring, metal, 
wood, or plastic), the Environmental Protection Agency recommends 
that you first clean the areas with soap (or detergent) and water and let 
the surface dry thoroughly. (Applying biocides without first cleaning 
away the dirt and oils from the surface is like painting over old paint 
without first cleaning and preparing the surface.) When the surface 
is dry—and within 24 hours of cleaning—apply a premixed spray-
on household biocide such as Lysol Disinfectant®, Original Pine-Sol® 
Cleaner, Tilex Mold & Mildew Remover® or Clorox® Clean-up® Cleaner 
+ Bleach. (Note two things: First, only a few of the common household 
cleaners can actually kill mold. Second, Tilex and Clorox contain bleach, 
which can discolor or stain surfaces, so follow the instructions on the 
container.) Always clean and apply a biocide to an area five or six times 
larger than any mold you see—mold can be present but not yet visible 
to the naked eye. A vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate 
air (HEPA) filter can be used to help remove nonvisible mold products 
from porous items such as fibers in sofas, chairs, drapes, and carpets—
provided the fibers are completely dry. Machine washing or dry-cleaning 
will remove mold from clothes.
6. Warning for Porous Surfaces and Large Surfaces. Do not clean or 
apply biocides to visible mold on porous surfaces such as sheetrock 
walls or ceilings or to large areas of visible mold on nonporous surfaces. 
Instead, notify us in writing and we will take appropriate action to comply 
with Section 92.051 et seq. of the Texas Property Code, subject to the 
special exceptions for natural disasters.
7. Compliance. Complying with this addendum will help prevent mold 
growth in your dwelling, and both you and we will be able to respond 
correctly if problems develop that could lead to mold growth. If you have 
questions about this addendum, please contact us at the management 
office or at the phone number shown in your Lease Contract.

 Texas Apartment AssociationLEASE ADDENDUM FOR SATELLITE DISH OR ANTENNA
Under a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) order, you as our resident have a right to install a transmitting or receiving satellite dish 
or antenna on the leased premises, subject to FCC limitations. We as a rental housing owner are allowed to impose reasonable restrictions 
relating to such installation. You are required to comply with these restrictions as a condition of installing such equipment. This addendum 
contains the restrictions that you and we agree to follow. 
1. Addendum.  This is an addendum to the lease between you and us for Apt. No.   in the  
   
   
                                         Apartments in  ,  
Texas OR
the house, duplex, etc. located at (street address)     
                                      in  , Texas.
2. Number and size.  You may install        satellite dish(es) or antenna(s) on the leased premises. A satellite dish may not exceed 
one meter (3.3 feet) in diameter. Antennas that only transmit signals or that are not covered by 47 CFR §1.4000 are prohibited. 
3. Location.  Your satellite dish or antenna must be located: (1) inside your dwelling; or (2) in an area outside your dwelling such as a 
balcony, patio, yard, etc. of which you have exclusive use under your lease. Installation is not permitted on any parking area, roof, exterior 
wall, window, window sill, fence, or common area, or in an area that other residents are allowed to use. A satellite dish or antenna may not 
protrude beyond the vertical and horizontal space that is leased to you for your exclusive use.
4. Safety and non-interference.  Your installation: (1) must comply with all applicable ordinances and laws and all reasonable safety 
standards; (2) may not interfere with our cable, telephone or electrical systems or those of neighboring properties; (3) may not be 
connected to our telecommunication systems; and (4) may not be connected to our electrical system except by plugging into a 110-volt 
duplex receptacle. If the satellite dish or antenna is placed in a permitted outside area, it must be safely secured by one of three methods: 
(1) securely attaching it to a portable, heavy object such as a small slab of concrete; (2) clamping it to a part of the building’s exterior that 
lies within your leased premises (such as a balcony or patio railing); or (3) any other method approved by us in writing. No other methods 
are allowed. We may require reasonable screening of the satellite dish or antenna by plants, etc., so long as it does not impair reception.
5. Signal transmission from exterior dish or antenna to interior of dwelling.  Under the FCC order, you may not damage or alter 
the leased premises and may not drill holes through outside walls, door jams, windowsills, etc. If your satellite dish or antenna is installed 
outside your dwelling (on a balcony, patio, etc.), the signals received by it may be transmitted to the interior of your dwelling only by the 
following methods: (1) running a “flat” cable under a door jam or windowsill in a manner that does not physically alter the premises and 
does not interfere with proper operation of the door or window; (2) running a traditional or flat cable through a pre-existing hole in the wall 
(that will not need to be enlarged to accommodate the cable); (3) connecting cables “through a window pane,” similar to how an external 
car antenna for a cellular phone can be connected to inside wiring by a device glued to either side of the window—without drilling a hole 
through the window; (4) wireless transmission of the signal from the satellite dish or antenna to a device inside the dwelling; or (5) any 
other method approved by us in writing.
6. Safety in installation.  In order to assure safety, the strength and type of materials used for installation must be approved by us. 
Installation must be done by a qualified person or company approved by us. Our approval will not be unreasonably withheld. An installer 
provided by the seller of the satellite dish or antenna is presumed to be qualified.
7. Maintenance.  You will have the sole responsibility for maintaining your satellite dish, antenna, and all related equipment.
8. Removal and damages.  You must remove the satellite dish or antenna and all related equipment when you move out of the dwelling. 
In accordance with the TAA Lease Contract, you must pay for any damages and for the cost of repairs or repainting caused by negligence, 
carelessness, accident. or abuse which may be reasonably necessary to restore the leased premises to its condition prior to the installation 
of your satellite dish, antenna or related equipment. You will not be responsible for normal wear and tear.
9. Liability insurance and indemnity.  You must take full responsibility for the satellite dish, antenna, and related equipment. If the dish 
or antenna is installed at a height or in some other way that could result in injury to others if it becomes unattached and falls, you must 
provide us with evidence of liability insurance to protect us against claims of personal injury and property damage to others, related to your 
satellite dish, antenna, and related equipment. The insurance coverage must be $             , which is an amount reasonably 
determined by us to accomplish that purpose. Factors affecting the amount of insurance include height of installation above ground level, 
potential wind velocities, risk of the dish/antenna becoming unattached and falling on someone, etc. You agree to hold us harmless and 
indemnify us against any of the above claims by others.
10.  Security deposit.  Your security deposit (in your Lease Contract) is increased by an additional reasonable sum of $   
q effective at time of installation or q effective within        days of installation to help protect us against possible repair costs, 
damages, or failure to remove the satellite dish, antenna and related equipment at time of move-out. Factors affecting any security 
deposit may vary, depending on: (1) how the dish or antenna is attached (nails, screws, lag bolts drilled into walls); (2) whether holes 
were permitted to be drilled through walls for the cable between the satellite dish and the TV; and (3) the difficulty and cost of repair or 
restoration after removal, etc. A security deposit increase does not imply a right to drill into or alter the leased premises.
11.  When you may begin installation.  You may start installation of your satellite dish, antenna, or related equipment only after you have: 
(1) signed this addendum; (2) provided us with written evidence of the liability insurance referred to in paragraph 9 of this addendum; 
(3) paid us the additional security deposit, if applicable, in paragraph 10; and (4) received our written approval, which may not be 
unreasonably withheld, of the installation materials and the person or company that will do the installation.
12. Miscellaneous.  If additional satellite dishes or antennas are desired, an additional lease addendum must be executed.

Texas Apartment AssociationLEASE ADDENDUM FOR ALLOCATING TRASH REMOVAL AND RECYCLING COSTS
1. Addendum.  This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No.   in the  
   
   
                                         Apartments in  ,  
Texas OR
the house, duplex, etc. located at (street address)    
                                       in  , Texas.
2. Reason for allocation.  Our property receives a single bill for trash removal/recycling. In recent years, many trash haulers 
and recyclers have increased fees dramatically to keep pace with rising costs associated with landfills and environmental 
mandates. By allocating this bill, we hope to make residents more aware of the true costs of waste disposal and to help 
reduce, reuse and recycle, and in turn, lower both costs and the impact on our environment.  
3. Your payment due date.  Payment of your allocated trash removal and recycling bill is due 16 days after the date it is 
postmarked or hand delivered to your apartment. You agree to mail or deliver payment to the place indicated on your bill 
so that payment is received no later than the due date. There will be a late charge of $            (not to exceed $3) if 
we do not receive timely payment. If you are late in paying the trash removal/recycling bill, we may immediately exercise all 
lawful remedies under your lease contract, including eviction—just like late payment of rent.
4.  Allocation procedures.  Your monthly base rent under the TAA Lease Contract does not include a charge for trash 
removal/recycling. You will pay separately for these monthly recurring fixed charges which are defined under the Lease 
as “Additional Rent”.  You may receive a separate bill from us each month or we may include these items as separate and 
distinct charges as part of a multi-item bill.  You agree to and we will allocate the monthly trash removal/recycling bill for the 
apartment community based on the allocation method checked below. (check only one)
q A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total square footage in the apartment community, i.e., your 
unit’s square footage divided by the total square footage in all apartment units.
q A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total number of people living in the apartment community, 
i.e., the number of people living in your apartment divided by the total number of people living in the entire apartment 
community for the month. (“People” for this purpose are all residents and occupants listed in leases at the apartment 
community as having a right to occupy the respective units.) 
q Half of your allocation will be based on your apartment unit’s share of total square footage and half will be based on your 
share of total people living in the apartment community, as described above.
q Per dwelling unit 
q Other formula (see attached page)
5.  Penalties and fees.  Only the total trash removal/recycling bill will be allocated. Penalties or interest for any late payment 
of the master trash removal/ recycling bill by us will be paid for by us and will not be allocated. A nominal administrative fee 
of $            per month (not to exceed $3) will be added to your bill for processing, billing and collecting.
Your trash removal/recycling allocation bill may include state and local sales taxes as required by state law.
6. Change of allocation formula.  The above allocation formula for determining your share of the trash removal/recycling 
costs cannot be changed except as follows: (1) you receive notice of the new formula at least 35 days before it takes effect; 
and (2) you agree to the change in a signed lease renewal or signed mutual agreement.
7. Right to examine records.  You may examine the trash removal/recycling bill we receive from the trash utility and our 
calculations related to the monthly allocation of the trash recycling/removal bill during regular weekday office hours. Please 
give us reasonable advance notice to gather the data.

Texas Apartment AssociationLEASE ADDENDUM FOR ALLOCATING STORMWATER/DRAINAGE COSTS
1. Addendum.  This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No.   in the  
   
   
                                         Apartments in  ,  
Texas. The terms of this addendum will control if the terms of the Lease and this addendum conflict.
2. Reason for allocation.  Governmental entities impose stormwater/drainage fees to help pay for the cost of maintaining 
the infrastructure needed to prevent flooding and lessen the impact of pollution on our water system. These fees can be 
significant. Our property has chosen to allocate this fee so residents are more aware of the true costs associated with these 
fees and so it is not necessary to raise rents to keep pace with these fee increases.  
3. Your payment due date.  Payment of your allocated stormwater/drainage bill is due 16 days after the date it is postmarked 
or hand delivered to your apartment. You agree to mail or deliver payment to the place indicated on your bill so that payment 
is received no later than the due date. You will pay a late charge of 5 percent of your stormwater/drainage bill if we do 
not receive timely payment. If you are late in paying the stormwater/drainage bill, we may immediately exercise all lawful 
remedies under your lease contract, including eviction—just like late payment of rent.
4. Allocation procedures.  Your monthly base rent under the TAA Lease Contract does not include a charge for stormwater/
drainage costs. You will pay separately for these monthly recurring fixed charges which are defined under the Lease as 
“Additional Rent”. You may receive a separate bill from us each month or we may include these items as separate and distinct 
charges as part of a multi-item bill. You agree to and we will allocate the monthly stormwater/drainage bill for the apartment 
community based on the allocation method checked below. (check only one)
q  A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total square footage in the apartment community, i.e. your unit’s 
square footage divided by the total square footage in all apartment units.
q  A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total number of people living in the apartment community, i.e. 
the number of people living in your apartment divided by the total number of people living in the entire apartment commu -
nity for the month. (“People” for this purpose are all residents and occupants listed in leases at the apartment community 
as having a right to occupy the respective units).
q  Half of your allocation will be based on your apartment’s share of total square footage and half will be based on your share 
of total people living in the apartment community, as described above.
q Per dwelling unit
q Other formula (see attached page)
5. Penalties and fees.  Only the total stormwater/drainage bill will be allocated. Penalties or interest for any late payment of 
the master stormwater/ drainage bill by us will be paid for by us and will not be allocated. A nominal administrative fee of  
$            per month (not to exceed $3) will be added to your bill for processing, billing and/or collecting.
6. Change of allocation formula.  The above allocation formula for determining your share of the stormwater/drainage bill 
cannot be changed except as follows: (1) you receive notice of the new formula at least 35 days before it takes effect; and 
(2) you agree to the change in a signed lease renewal or signed mutual agreement.
7. Right to examine records.  You may examine our stormwater/drainage bills from the utility company, and our calculations 
relating to the monthly allocation of the stormwater/drainage bills during regular weekday office hours. Please give us 
reasonable advance notice to gather the data.

                                         Apartments in  ,  
Texas. The terms of this addendum will control if the terms of the Lease and this addendum conflict.
2. Reason for allocation.  Apartment owners receive bills for services provided to residents and charges for various 
governmental fees. These are direct costs that the apartment community incurs. In order to help control the cost of rent, we 
have chosen to allocate the services and governmental fees indicated below through an allocated bill using a standardized 
formula to distribute these costs fairly. While we may impose a nominal fee to help recover our costs in administering these 
bills, we do not add any other costs to these bills and make no profit of f of them.

that payment is received no later than the due date. You will pay a late charge of $            (not to exceed $3) if we 
do not receive timely payment. If you are late in paying the services and governmental fee bill, we may cut off services, as 
allowed by law, and we may immediately exercise all other lawful remedies, including eviction—just like late payment of rent. 
5. Allocation procedures.  Your monthly base rent under the TAA Lease Contract does not include a charge for the services 
and governmental fees indicated above. You will pay separately for these charges which are defined under the Lease as 
“Additional Rent”.  You may receive a separate bill from us each month or we may include these items as separate and 
distinct charges as part of a multi-item bill.

unit’s square footage divided by the total square footage in all apartment units.
q A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of the total number of people living in the apartment community, 
i.e., the number of people living in your apartment divided by the total number of people living in the entire apartment 
community for the month. (“People” for this purpose are all residents and occupants listed in leases at the apartment 
community as having a right to occupy the respective units). 
q Half of your allocation will be based on your apartment unit’s share of total square footage and half will be based on your 
share of total people living in the apartment community, as described above.
q Per dwelling unit 
q Other formula (see attached page)
6. Penalties and fees.  Only the total of the services and governmental fee bills will be allocated. Penalties or interest

fee bills cannot be changed except as follows: (1) you receive notice of the new formula at least 35 days before it takes effect; 
and (2) you agree to the change in a signed lease renewal or signed mutual agreement.
8. Right to examine records.  You may examine our service and governmental fee bills from the companies and governmental

 LEASE ADDENDUM FOR ALLOCATING  CENTRAL SYSTEM UTILITY COSTS    1.  Addendum.  This is an addendum to the TAA Lease Contract for Apt. No. ___________ in the Park Tower Apartments in Austin, Texas. 2.  Reason for allocation. When utility costs for operating a central heating/air conditioning system are paid by the property owner, residents have little incentive to conserve.  This often results in a waste of our state’s natural resources and adds to the overhead of the property- and that usually means higher rents.  Allocation of central systems utility costs saves money for residents because it encourages conservation. 3.  Payment due date. Payment of your allocated share of the central system utility costs is due 7 days after the date it is postmarked or hand delivered to your apartment.  We may include this item as a separate and distinct charge as part of a multi-item bill.  Unless otherwise provided, you agree to pay it at the same place your rent is paid under your lease.  There will be late charge of 5 percent of your bill if your bill is not timely paid.  Central system allocation is governed by the Public Utility Commission. 4.  Allocation procedures.  You agree to the allocation system described below for utilities used in operating the central system(s) for the entire apartment community.  During the lease term, we are authorized to allocate such central system utility costs to your apartment unit as described in paragraph 7 on the basis of your submetered electricity usage. 5.  What is covered.  Your monthly rent in paragraph 6 of your TAA Lease Contract does not cover the cost of electricity used in operating a central heating/air conditioning system.  You will receive a separate bill from us for such utilities, as follows:  Your monthly share of the electricity for operating a CENTRAL HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM is described in paragraph 7. 6.  No extras. No administrative or other fee will be added to the total utility costs to be allocated for operating the central systems.  Penalties or interest for our late payment of the utility bills for operating the central system will be paid by us and will not be allocated. 7.  Formula. Allocation will be based on a submetered utility.  The formula for allocating utility costs for the above central system will a percentage calculated by dividing the submetered electricity consumption in your dwelling unit by the total submetered consumption in all dwelling units in the apartment community.  The submetered utility being used for the central system allocation is electricity. 8.  Previous average.  The average monthly amount of the allocation share of the central system utilities for apartment no. ___________ for the most recent calendar year was:  $___________  for the central HVAC system.   This average represents an allocation based on your submetered utility. 9.  Change of allocation formula.  The above allocation formula for determining your share of central system operating costs cannot be changed except as follows:  (1) the new formula is one approved by the PUC; (2) you receive notice of the new formula at least 90 days before it takes effect; (3) you agree to the change in a signed lease renewal or signed mutual agreement. 10. Right to examine records.  The Resident may examine records of the central system utility bills and the calculations relating to the monthly allocation of the central system utility cost during regular weekday office hours.     The undersigned hereby acknowledges that he or she has read, understands and accepts the terms and conditions of this Addendum.  Resident Signatures (All occupants of the Premises are required to sign)  Date:    Date:    Owner or Owner’s Representative Signature  Date:    02/06/2015

Mold and Mildew  
Mold and mildew can be a problem!  It grows in your shower, closets, around plants, on clothing,

In an effort to help you avoid  any  mold or  mildew problem in your apartment, we would like to 
make you aware of the following:  
 
♦ Let the sun shine in!  Keep curtains and blinds open.  Mildew hates  natural light.  
♦ Use the air conditioner to your advantage.  Set your thermostat at a 75 degree  setting or 
lower and leave it on “auto” throughout the day, even when you are not home, as the cool, dry air reduces the moisture that promotes mildew.  Notify m anagement immediately of any 
air conditioning problems.  
♦ Make room for airflow in your closets.  Just keeping the door ajar will increase air  flow.  
Moisture absorbers are available at grocery and drug stores and will stop mildew from 
creeping up the sides of your best suit or dress.  
♦ Lots of plants mean  a lot of humidity.  Plants brighten your apartment, but they  also give off 
large amounts of moisture.  So, when you bring the great outdoors inside, keep the air conditioning turned on.  
♦ Use the clothes dryer for freshly washed clothing.  Air drying clothes inside your  apartment 
adds to the overall humidity.

Apartment #  
 
Hardwood floors require regular maintenance and attention to keep them

 Upon move- out, your hardwood floors will be inspected for damage beyond  
normal wear and tear. Residents will be responsible for actual damages based 
on a contracted estimate following move out.

and complete replacement of floors may result in charges up to or exceeding 
$6,000.  
 
 
To help avoid charges and maintain your floor s, please:  
 
1. Regularly sweep and vacuum the floor to prevent dirt and du st from 
accumulating , potentially  scratching the finish.  
 
2. Remove sand and water  immediately from your floo rs, as both may 
severely damage the wood .

cleaner that is made to be chemically neutral, specifically designed to 
clean hardwood floors.

Revised March  15, 2019  Hold Harmless Notice and Acknowledgment  
 
Community Name: _____________________________________________   Apartment Number: ___________  
 
Welcome to our community, we hope that you will find living here to be an enjoyable 
experience. Unfortunately, we live at a time when crime is a genuine concern. We 
should  all take care to  protect our person and property. By taking an active role in our 
own security, we can hopefully minimize our exposure to the criminal element.  
 
We do our best to keep  residents informed  of significant issues at our community. We 
hope that doing so will assist residents to take appropriate precautions to protect 
themselves, guests, and personal property.  The terms used in this Addendum are the 
same as the terms in your Apartment Lease Contract . 
 
Notice to Resident:  
 In your Lease you have agreed that none of our security measures are an express or implied warranty of security –  or a guarantee against crime or of reduced risk of crime. Unless  otherwise 
provided by law, we are not liable to you, your occupants, or your guests for injury, damage, or loss to person or property caused by criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary, 
assault, vandalism, or other crimes.  
 You have al so agreed that you will defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from all liability 
arising from your conduct or that of your invitees, your occupants, your guests, or our representatives who at your request perform services not contemplated in your lease.  
 Please note that even if previously provided, we are not obligated to furnish security personnel, 
patrols , lighting, gates, fences, or other forms of security unless required by law. If you, your 
occupants or your guests are affected by crime, you should report to the appropriate local law 
enforcement agency.  
 
No security system, including controlled access gates, courtesy patrol services or electronic 
intrusion safety devices can guarantee protection against crime.  Even elaborate security 
systems are subj ect to mechanical malfunctions, tampering, human error or personnel 
absenteeism, and can be defeated or avoided by a person with a criminal intent .  Further, even 
if the owner is aware of a problem with security devices, repairs to such devices cannot always 
be completed immediately.  Therefore, residents should always proceed on the assumption that 
no security systems exist.    
 If security systems, security devices or patrol services are used at this community, no 
represe ntation is being made that they will be effective to prevent injury, theft or vandalism. Any 
patrol service that may be provided is made up of unarmed independent contractors that have no greater authority under the law to restrain or arrest criminals than  the ordinary citizen.    
 
We do not warrant that any security systems, security devices or services employed at this 
community will discourage or prevent breaches of security, intrusions, thefts or incidents of 
violent crime.  Further, we reserve the righ t to reduce, modify or eliminate any security system, 
security devices or services (other than those required by statute) at any time; and Resident agrees that such action shall not be a breach of any obligation or warranty.   
 
If controlled access gates o r intrusion alarms are provided, Resident will be instructed by 
Management, or furnished written operating instructions . It is Resident’s responsibility to become 
familiar with proper operation and to bring any questions to the attention of Management.  
Further, Resident agrees to promptly notify M anagement in writing of any problem, defect, 
malfunction or failure of door locks, window latches, controlled access gates, intrusion alarms and any other safety -related device.

Revised March  15, 2019   
If Resident’s apartment is equipped with an intrusion alarm, Resident agrees to be responsible for 
all fines, penalties and other charges resulting from or attributable to the alarm, including false 
alarm charges.  Resident acknowledges that any furnished intrusion alarm offered in the 
Residence or on the Property is for the sole purpose of protecting the Owner’s Property and not for the security, safety or welfare of the Resident or any guest or occupant of the Resident.  
Property Management/Owner acknowledges that it shall remain in compliance with state 
statutes regarding security devices required by law.  
 
Acknowledgment by Resident:  
I have read, understand and agree with the above notice. I have received no representations 
or warranties, either expressed or implied, as to the over all safety of the property and/or any 
security system on the property. Neither the owner nor the owner’s agents or representatives have , in any way, stated or implied to me that security of person or property is provided, 
promised or guaranteed or that the  apartment community was or will be free from crime.   
 I further acknowledge that neither the owner nor the owner’s agents or representatives are 
obligated under any circumstances to respond to any signal from an intrusion alarm system. The 
responsibility  for protecting myself, my property and my family, guests and invitees from acts of 
crime is the sole responsibility of myself and law enforcement agencies.  
 
I also acknowledge that I have received and will review the attached brochure entitled 
Personal S afety Tips . 
 
Unless otherwise provided by law, I hereby release and hold harmless Management from claims 
arising out of criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary, assault, vandalism, or 
other crimes.   I acknowledge that neither the owner  nor the owner’s agents or representatives 
are liable to me based upon any claim that adequate security was not provided to me. I acknowledge that the foregoing shall also be binding upon occupants of my apartment or 
guests I or occupants of my apartment b ring to the apartment community and heirs  of me or 
occupants of my apartment .  I acknowledge that my lease is a written contract and that I have 
the responsibility to read it and ask necessary questions before I sign it.  I acknowledge that I 
have had the opportunity to do so.  I also acknowledge that the owner’s agents and 
representatives do not have authority to make changes or modifications in the terms of this 
document.  This acknowledgement cannot be altered or enlarged by oral agreement.

Revised March  15, 2019  PERSONAL SAFETY TIPS  
 
 
 
We would like to thank you for choosing a community managed by Gables Residential as your home. We hope  you will find living in our community to be an enjoyable experience. The following are a few safety 
tips for your consideration. This is not intended to  be an exhaustive list, but merely suggestions to assist you 
in being safe. In the event that you are in need of police assistance or protection of any kind, you should always contact the local law  enforcement agency immediately. In the event of an emergency, call 911.  
Please do not contact the answering  service first, as this could delay the response time. Your safety is the 
responsibility of the local law  enforcement agency and yourself. It is our sincere desire that you have a 
happy, healthy, and safe l iving experience in our community. We  believe that by taking an active role in 
your own safety, you can avoid any unnecessary problems.  
 
 
EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBERS:  
It is important that each member of your household knows or has access to local emergency  
telephone numbers. We encourage you to obtain and record the appropriate telephone number for  
ambulance services, the fire department, and the local police department, and any other emergency 
service you think could be needed . You may want to consider posting them inside a kitchen cabinet, or on  
the refrigerator. Be sure and ask the local police department if you can utilize the 911 number to access  
all emergency services.  
 
 
FIRE SAFETY:  
• Grilling on your patio is strictly prohibited. This is dangerous and is in violation of your lease 
agreement. 
• Dispose of fireplace embers/ashes properly. Remember – they stay hot long after the fire is 
extinguished . 
• Keep combustible items away from the fireplace.  
• Check your smoke detector regularly and contact the management staff immediately if repairs 
are necessary.  
• Have an escape plan and practice it.  
• Know where the nearest fire extinguisher is located and how to operate it properly. Use only a Type 
B fire extinguisher on a grease fire.  
 
 
COOKING SAFETY : 
• Do not l eave cooking food unattended.  
• If a grease fire starts:  
o Cover the fire with a metal lid or similar object.  
o Turn off the burner.  
o Do not use water to extinguish the fire.  
o Do not handle/move the burning pan while it is on fire or hot.  
o Call the fire department if you have any doubt that the fire is out or you think it will restart.  
 
 
PERSONAL SAFETY:  
• Always ensure that your apartment is locked securely.  
• Avoid walking outside alone.  
• Leave a radio playing softly when you are not home.  
• Close and lock your windows and sliding glass doors.  
• Purchase a lamp timer at a hardware store and set it to light the apartment when you are not 
home.  
• If you have an entry code, don’t give it out to guests or strangers.  
• Arrange to have your newspaper delivery stopped when you are on vacation.  
• Use your deadbolt, even when you are at home. 
• Never answer your door unless you know who is on the other side. If you do not know the person, 
do not open the door unless you are satisfied with their identity.  
• Be careful to whom you give or lend your keys.  
• If you have lost a key, ask management to re -key the locks.

Revised March  15, 2019  • Report to management (in writing, dated and signed) any malfunction of devices outside your 
apartment home such as broken gate locks, burned out stairwell or parking lot lights.  
• Close y our curtains or blinds at night.  
  
PERSONAL SAFETY INVOLVING YOUR VEHICLE : 
• Lock your vehicle when you are driving. Lock the doors and roll up the windows when you leave the vehicle parked.  
• Don’t leave visible items in your vehicle, such as purses, telephones, briefcases, luggage, 
computers, packages,  money, sporting equipment etc. 
• Don’t leave your keys in your vehicle.  
• Carry your key ring in your hand as you walk to your car. Don’t ever stand near your car fumbling for your keys.  
• Look in the back seat befor e you get in your car.  
  
INSURANCE COVERAGE:  
In addition to the above tips, we strongly recommend you buy property insurance to cover your personal possessions. The  apartment community’s insurance does not cover your belongings.  If you are interested in 
obtaining property insurance, the leasing office can provide more information.  
  
AFTER HOURS LOCKOUTS : 
The apartment community does not provide an after -hours lockout service. If you should lock yourself  
out of your apartment after the management office is  closed, it is your responsibility to call a locksmith  
to gain entry to your apartment. If the lock is changed by the locksmith, you must notify the office so  
that a duplicate key can be obtained for the office.  During business hours, we will be happy to i ssue you an 
extra key at your request  within the provisions of the lease.  If you should lose your keys, please do not hesitate 
to ask us to change or re -key your locks. We will be  more than happy to do so within the provisions of your 
lease.

1 INSURANCE LEASE ADDENDUM  
This Insurance Lease Addendum (this “Addendum”) is made and entered into as of the 
______ day of ___________________, _______ (the “Effective Date”) by and between 
______________________________________________________________________________ 
(“you” or “your”) and _______________________________ Apartments (“we”, “us” or “our”) 
upon the terms and conditions stated herein.  The purpose of this Addendum is to express the terms upon which you will comply with your obligations under the Apartment Lease Contract 
(the “Lease”) which requires that you maintain rent er’s or liability insurance.  This Addendum is 
attached to and made a part of the Lease under which you have the right to occupy apartment no. 
__________ in our apartment community. For and in consideration of the mutual promises 
contained herein and in the Leas e and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and 
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:  
1. Our Insurance Coverage.  You understand that our property or liability insurance may
not protect you, your guests or any occupants against loss or damage to personal property orbelongings, or cover your liability for loss or damage caused by your actions or those of any
occupant of the dwelling or guest. You understand that by not maintaining a renter’s or liability
insurance policy, you may be liable to us and others for loss or damage caused by your actions or
those of any occupant or guest in the dwelling.
2. Your Insurance Requirements. You understand that the Lease requires you to buy and
maintain renter’s or liability insurance. You agreed to purchase renter’s or liability insurance
from an insurance company of your choice. The limits of liability coverage must be in an amount
not less than the lesser of: (i) $ ___________ per occurrence; or (ii) the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law.  You will provide us with written proof of compliance with thisAddendum on or prior to the lease commencement date, and any time we request it. Your
insurance company will be required to provide notice to us within 30 days of any cancellation,
non-renewal, or other material change in your insurance policy. You acknowledge that liability
insurance does not protect you against loss or damage to your personal property or belongings –
only a renter’s insurance policy does this. It also does not protect you from losses caused by
flooding. Flood insurance is different than renter’s insurance. For more information regarding
renter’s or flood insurance, contact the Texas Department of Insurance.
3. Failure to Maintain Insurance.  In the event you fail to maintain renter’s insurance as
required by this section, you shall be in violation of the Lease; in which case, Owner shall be
entitled to pursue any rights or remedies. Additionally, in the event of such default, you shall be
required to pay, upon Owner’s demand, as a liquidated damage, the amount of $25.00 to Owner
for each month or a portion of a month you are in default of this Addendum. If you fail to
maintain the appropriate level of insurance, you agree that: (i) the liquidated damage assessed in
this section is a reasonable estimate of uncertain damages to the Owner that is incapable of
precise calculation and results from Owner’s time, cost and additional exposure resulting from
your failure to maintain the proper level of insurance; (ii) Owner may, but is not obligated to, use
the liquidated damage amount to purchase coverage for property damage to protect Owner fromdamage caused by you; (iii) if Owner purchases additional insurance, such insurance will not
protect you against loss or damage to your personal property or belongings; and (iv) subrogation
will be allowed with respect to any claims Owner’s insurance carrier may have against you.

2 4. Insurance Choice.  You acknowledge that, if we inform you of an insurance carrier that

are doing so only for the purpose of informing you and not, in any way, to aide in the transaction
of the business of the carrier. We will not discuss specific insurance policy terms or conditions
with you.  You acknowledge that we do not engage in the business of insurance by receiving or
collecting any consideration for insurance, including, but not limited to, a premium. We do not

any aspect of the business of insurance including, but not limited to, soliciting, negotiating,
procuring or effectuating insurance or a renewal of insurance or disseminating information
relating to coverage or rates. We do not own or operate an insurance company and make no
guarantees, representations or promises concerning insurance or services provided by an
insurance carrier, whether or not we identify an insurance carrier for you to call. You are under
no obligation to purchase renter's insurance or liability insurance through any specific carrier.

LEASE ADDENDUM FOR 
ALLOCATING NATURAL G AS COSTS  
 
1. Addendum.   This is an addendum to the TAA Lease 
Contract for  Apt. No. ______________ in the 
___________________________________ Apartments in 
_____________________________________, Texas.  
 
2. Reason for allocation.  This community has installed and 
maintains a natural gas boiler system to provide hot water 
to Residents.  This highly efficient system is more reliable, 
environmentally friendly and less expensive than providing 
apartments with individual hot water heaters.  Further, the 
risks associated with having hot water heaters in every 
apartment, including potential water leaks, are greatly 
reduced.   
   
3. Your payment due date.   Payment of your allocated gas 
bill is due 16 days after the date it is postmarked or hand 
delivered to your apartment.  You agree to mail or deliver 
payment to the place indicated on  your bill so that payment 
is received no later than the due date.  You will pay a late 
charge of $3.00  (not to exceed $3)  if we do not receive 
timely payment.  If you are late in paying the gas bill, we 
may not cut off your gas; but we may immediately exe rcise 
all other lawful remedies, including eviction —just like late 
payment of rent.  
 
4. Allocation procedures.   Your monthly rent under the TAA 
Lease Contract does not  include a charge for natural gas.  
Instead, you will be receiving a separate bill from us each 
month for gas.  We may include this item as a separate and 
distinct charge as part of a multi-item bill.   
 
 You agree to and we will allocate the monthly gas b ill for 
the apartment community based on the allocation method 
below.   
 
 A percentage reflecting your apartment unit’s share of 
the total hot water usage in the apartment community, 
i.e., your unit’s hot water usage (as determined by an 
individual hot water submeter sp ecific to your unit)  
divided by the total hot water usage in all apartment 
units.   
6. Common area deduction.  Only the total mastermeter gas 
bill will be allocated.  Before the bill is allocated, a 
deduction of ____  percent will be made to cover estimated 
gas consumption in any common areas, such as:  (1) gas 
dryers and room heating in laundry rooms; or (2) hot water 
heating for pools, spas or laundry rooms.  Penalties or 
interest for any late payment of the mastermeter gas bill by 
us will be paid for by us  and will not be allocated.  A 
nominal administrative fee of $0.00 per month (not to 
exceed $3) will be added to your bill for processing, billing 
and/or collecting.   
 
7. Change of allocation formula.  The above allocation 
formula for determining your sha re of the natural gas bill 
cannot be changed except as follows: (1) you receive notice 
of the new formula at least 35 days before it takes effect; 
and (2) you agree to the change in a signed lease renewal or 
signed mutual agreement.  
 
8. Right to examine records.   You may examine our gas bills 
from the utility company and our calculations relating to 
the monthly allocation of the gas bills during regular 
weekday office hours.  Please give us reasonable advance 
notice to gather the data.

LEASE ADDENDUM FOR 
BOILER MANAGEMENT FEES 
 
1. Addendum.   This is an addendum to the TAA Lease 
Contract  for  Apt. No. ______________ in the 
___________________________________ Apartments in 
_____________________________________, Texas. 
 
2. Boiler Management.  This community has enetered into 
an agreement with a service provider that will manage the operation of a natural gas boiler system to provide hot water to Residents. This highl y efficient system is more 
reliable, environmentally friendly and less expensive than 
providing apartments with individual hot water heaters.  
Further, the risks associated with having hot water heaters in every apartment, including potential water leaks, are greatly reduced.   
  The boiler management fee does not include the cost of 
natural gas used to operate the boiler system and may be in addition to other fees for utilites and/or services.  However, 
because of its highly efficient nature the combined bill for 
the management fee along with the utility costs directly associated with providing hot water are consistently less than the utility bills Residents would pay if responsible for similar costs for individual hot water heaters. 
  
 
3. Your payment due date.   Payment of your boiler 
management fee bill is due 16 days after the date it is 
postmarked or hand delivered to your apartment.  You agree to mail or deliver payment to the place indicated on your bill so that payment is received no later than the due date.  You will pay a late charge of 5 percent of your boiler management fee bill if we do not receive timely payment.  We may immediately exercise all other lawful remedies, including eviction—just like late payment of rent. 
 
4. Billing.   Your monthly rent under the TAA Lease Contract 
does not include a charge for boiler management.  Instead, 
you will be receiving a separate monthly bill.  We may include this item as a separate and distinct charge as part of a multi-item bill.    
 You agree to and we will allocate the monthly boiler 
managent fee for the apartment community based on the 
allocation method below.
  
 
 $_________ per unit  
6. Change of fee.  The above boiler management fee cannot 
be changed except as follows: (1) you receive notice of the new fee at least 35 days before it takes effect; and (2) you agree to the change in a signed lease renewal or signed mutual agreement. 
 7. Right to examine records.   You may examine the boiler 
management fee bill received by the Community during regular weekday office hours.  Please give us reasonable 
advance notice to gather the data.

PUBLIC  HEALTH  INFORMATION  ADDENDUM  
1.DWELLING  UNIT DESCRIPTION.
Unit No. 
,
(street  address) in 
(city) (state)  
(zip code). 
2. LEASE CONTRACT DESCRIPTION.
Lease  Contract Date:
Owner’s name:
Residents  (list all residents ): 
This Addendum constitutes  an addendum to the above 
described Lease  Contract for the above described 
premises and is hereby incorporated  into and made a 
part of such Lease  Contract.  Where the terms or 
conditions found in this Addendum vary or contradict  
any terms or conditions  found in the Lease  Contract,  
this Addendum shall control. 
3. GERMS  AND  INFECTIOUS  AND
COMMUNICABLE  DISEASES.  Multi-family
dwellings  such  as apartment  communities,
condominiums, and assisted  living facilities  face
unique challenges  in protecting against the spread
of germs  and infectious  and communicable
diseases. Extra precautions must  be taken to avoid
the unnecessary spread  of germs, viruses and
diseases due to the close-quartered nature of
many  multi-family  dwellings,  with particular
attention  given to common-  areas or shared-areas
where  people  congregate,  or other  frequently
touched surfaces  such as exerciseThe health and  safety  of our community requires  strict  adherence  to recommendations  made by the Centers 
for Disease  Control and Prevention  (CDC), state and federal  governments,  and health professionals. This 
addendum contains  important  information  to help  promote  and maintain a healthy  living environment.
rooms and equipment,  laundry  facilities,  lobbies and 
recreational rooms, elevators,  and stairwells.  
4.WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP.  In order to minimize
the potential risks associated  with germs, viruses, and
infectious and communicable  diseases, it is important for
all residents to maintain  appropriate  personal hygiene
habits, as outlined by the CDC as well as state and local
health  departments. This includes, but is not limited to,
washing your hands often, for at least twenty  (20) seconds,
especially  after you have been in a public place, or after
blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.  The CDC
also recommends frequently  washing your face, body, and
hair with soap and clean, running water.  Appropriate
facial  hygiene practices  include not only washing your
face but also properly c a r i n g  for teeth, mouth, eyes,
contact lenses,  and ears.
Practicing  good hygiene etiquette  is also important in 
protecting the health  of the community.  Covering coughs 
and sneezing  with a tissue  (and immediately  discarding used 
tissues),  or coughing or sneezing into your elbow, regardless 
of whether  or not you feel sick, will help prevent the spread  
of serious germs and illnesses.  
Avoiding people who are sick and avoiding people when  you 
feel sick,  promotes  additional  protections  against  
unnecessarily  spreading  germs within  the community. 
Taking additional  measures  inside  your dwelling unit, such 
as cleaning and disinfecting  frequently  touched surfaces,  
including tables,  doorknobs, light switches,  countertops, 
handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets,  faucets, and sinks  
will also reduce your chances  of spreading germs and/or 
infecting  yourself and your family.  
5.CLEANLINESS OF COMMON  AREAS. Keeping the
community clean and safe for all individuals  requires
constant and mindful attention,  particularly  in common,
shared or high-traffic  areas.  Although  the Landlord’s
policies  under the Lease  Contract include proactively
cleaning and sanitizing  these  areas,  it is impossible  for the
Landlord to employ measures  that guarantee against the
spread of germs. R e s i d e n t s  e ngaging in efforts  to
keep these  areas clean will assist  in protection of the
community.  Before use, Resident shall wipe down
touched surfaces (such as workout equipment, pool and
patio furniture, and tabletops, etc.) to the  degree desired 
by Resident.

Neither owner nor management shall have liability to resident 
for damage or injury sustained due to the improper acts of others who fail to follow local, state and federal guidelines or use the facilities and amenities while contagious with a virus. The limitations in this section are applicable to the extent allowed by law.  
There is no representation or warranty that: (1) the premises are or will remain free of viruses, (2) persons on the premises are not carrying viruses; or (3) exposure to viruses cannot occur on the premises. 
8. SPECIAL PROVISIONS. The following special
provisions also apply: _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________Additionally, the Landlord  cannot address  problems 
unless it knows about them, so  promptly alerting  the 
Landlord  to a condition is essential  in protecting the 
community from  u n n e c e s s a r i l y  hazardous conditions.  
Regardless of the proactive measures the Landlord  
may take, it is impossible  to provide protection 
against all germs, viruses, and/or  infectious  and 
communicable  diseases. 
6.GOVERNMENT ORDINACES, LAWS, AND
MANDATES  ISSUED  IN EMERGENCY
SITUATIONS.  You are expected  to comply with all
local, state,  and federally  mandated public health
guidelines and restrictions.  This includes, but is not
limited to, requiring you to wear  face masks or
coverings  when  in public  places  or places  of
businesses,  stay-at-home  orders,  restrictions  or
limitations  on congregating  in groups, and other
prohibitions on social  interactions.  For purposes of
compliance with government restrictions,  all common- 
areas and amenity-related  areas,  including but not
limited to exercise  rooms, swimming and picnic areas,
laundry and utility  rooms, conference  and party rooms,
and the management office,  are deemed a place of
business and are areas where  you are expected  and
required to strictly  comply with any applicable
government impositions.
7.LIMITATION ON LANDLORD LIABILITY.
In the event of a public health  emergency declared in
response to any outbreak of infectious disease, the
Landlord may,  at its option, limit resident access  to
certain amenities,  common areas,  the leasing  office,  or
other common elements of the subject property. In the
event of any such public health  emergency, these
measures may be necessary for the Landlord  to comply
with CDC and local regulations  in order to encourage
and maintain  appropriate  social  distancing  and
otherwise limit the spread  of any such infectious
disease. Landlord may close  or limit resident access  to
any such common areas  or amenities  with or without
notice to residents upon the declaration  of a state of
emergency or public health  emergency.   The Parties
expressly  accept and agree that Landlord’s limitation
of access  to or closing  of common  areas  and amenity
spaces shall not relieve  Resident of any financial
obligations arising  under the Lease, and shall  not serve
as grounds for either party’s termination  of the Lease.
Landlord may reopen any such amenity spaces or
common areas upon notice  from appropriate public
health  authorities  that it is safe to do so, but shall not
be obligated to do so until Landlord,  in its discretion,
determines that doing so is in the best interest  of the
health, safety,  and welfare  of the community.
